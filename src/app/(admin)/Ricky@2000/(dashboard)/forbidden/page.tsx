/**
 * Where `requirePermission` sends an administrator who is signed in but
 * lacks the permission for the page they asked for.
 *
 * Kept separate from the login redirect on purpose. Bouncing an
 * authenticated staff member to a sign-in form reads as "your session
 * expired", so they sign in again, land back on the same wall, and repeat —
 * a loop with no exit and no explanation. Saying plainly that the account
 * lacks the permission tells them the one useful thing: who to ask.
 *
 * It sits inside the dashboard shell rather than standing alone, so the
 * sidebar is right there to move on with. A dead-end page for a recoverable
 * situation is its own small failure.
 *
 * `requireAdmin` still runs, so an anonymous visitor who guesses this URL
 * gets the login page rather than confirmation that the admin area exists
 * in this shape.
 *
 * With Wave A's single ADMIN role this page is unreachable in practice —
 * every permission is held. It stays because the alternative is discovering
 * it is missing on the day a restricted role is introduced.
