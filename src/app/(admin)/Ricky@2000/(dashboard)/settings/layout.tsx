/**
 * The frame around every Settings page: the title with search beside it, the
 * section list, and the content.
 *
 * Like the dashboard layout above it, this fetches the profile to decide
 * which sections to *list* and search — it is not what protects them. Every
 * page under it calls `requirePermission` itself, and every action
 * authorises again.
 *
 * ── Why the grid tracks are `minmax(0, …)` ────────────────────────────
 * A grid track sized `auto` grows to its widest child's content. The phone
 * section row scrolls horizontally, so its content is as wide as every tab
 * laid end to end — and an `auto` track took that width, stretching the whole
 * page to ~1,400px on a phone. `minmax(0, 1fr)` pins the track to the
 * viewport and leaves the row to scroll inside it.
