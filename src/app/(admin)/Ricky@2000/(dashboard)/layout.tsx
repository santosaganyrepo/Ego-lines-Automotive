/**
 * Chrome for the authenticated dashboard.

 * Applies to everything under this route group and — importantly — to
 * nothing in `(auth)`. That is why the sign-in, forgot-password and
 * set-password screens live in a sibling group: they must not inherit a
 * sidebar that offers navigation to someone who has not signed in.
 *
 * ── On the requireAdmin() call below ──────────────────────────────────
 * It is here to *fetch* the profile the bar renders, not to protect the
 * routes beneath it. A layout cannot do that: Next.js states plainly that
 * "a layout also does not control whether the rest of the route renders",
 * and Partial Rendering means it does not even re-run on client-side
 * navigation between admin pages.
 *
 * Every page under this layout therefore calls `requireAdmin()` or
 * `requirePermission()` itself. That looks redundant and is not. The DAL's
 * `cache()` makes the repetition free within a request.
