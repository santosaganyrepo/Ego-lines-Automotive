/**
 * A single vehicle.
 *
 * ── Visibility ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `getPublishedVehicleBySlug` looks the slug up *with* the PUBLISHED
 * clause rather than by unique key, so a draft, a sold vehicle or an
 * archived one is indistinguishable from a slug that never existed — this
 * page cannot leak one by forgetting to check, because there is nothing
 * here to remember. The query is `cache()`d, so `generateMetadata` and the
 * page body share a single database round trip.
 *
 * ── Shape of the page ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Photography, then the decision, then the detail:
 *
 *     back to listings
 *          →  gallery, full width
 *          →  condition · name · price · request / WhatsApp
 *          →  specifications | features   (one at a time)
 *          →  description
 *          →  you may also like
 *
 * Every band runs the full measure and stacks. The previous version put
 * the gallery in a seven-column well beside a five-column specification
 * card, then a short description beside a price panel — which meant that
 * on any listing whose description ran shorter than the panel beside it,
 * a third of the page was empty. Photography-first, as the design brief
 * asks, is also the layout with nothing to leave hanging.
 *
 * The summary band is the whole decision in one place: what the car is,
 * what it costs, and the two ways to act on it, with nothing between the
 * price and the buttons. Specifications and features follow *after* it,
 * because they are what someone reads to talk themselves into or out of a
 * car they have already priced.
 *
 * ── One price, and only one ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The page states the vehicle price and nothing else. It used to carry a
 * breakdown adding shipping, clearing and other charges into an
 * "estimated delivered price", and that was removed on the dealership's
 * instruction: those figures move with freight rates, the port and the
 * destination, and the business is not in a position to stand behind them
 * on a public page before a specific vehicle has been quoted. A number a
 * customer can budget against and the dealership cannot honour is the
 * single most expensive thing this site could publish — worse than
 * publishing nothing, because it is quoted back at collection.
 *
 * So the page says what it knows, says plainly that the rest is confirmed
 * in the quotation, and routes the customer to the conversation where it
 * genuinely is confirmed. The `shippingEstimate`, `clearingEstimate` and
 * `otherChargesEst` columns still exist and are still editable by an
 * operator; they are simply no longer read by anything customer-facing,
 * which is why the public DTO no longer selects them.
 *
 * The price is stated exactly once, in the summary band, rather than once
 * beside the heading and again in a panel further down. Two copies of the
 * same figure on one page is how a listing ends up showing two different
 * ones after an edit touches only the surface someone remembered.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately not on this page ─────────────────────────────
 * The breadcrumb trail and the listing reference. The trail restated the
 * navigation that is already fixed to the top of every page and cost the
 * first line of the listing to do it; a single "Back to listings" control
 * is the one move a customer actually makes from here. The reference
 * number is an internal identifier — it stays in the metadata, in the
 * structured data as the SKU, and in the WhatsApp message this page
 * composes, all places where it does work. On the page itself it was a
 * code the customer was shown and given no reason to care about.
 *
 * The page closes on other vehicles from the same make rather than on a
 * third copy of the two actions that already sit in the summary band and
 * in the pinned mobile bar. See RelatedVehicles for why.
 *
 * On a phone the quote action is additionally pinned to the bottom of the
 * screen for the whole page. See VehicleMobileActionBar.

/**
 * Structured data for the listing.
 *
 * A `Car` (a subtype of `Product`) with an `Offer`, which is what lets a
 * search engine show the price and availability against the result — the
 * brief asks for individually indexable vehicle pages, and this is the
 * difference between being indexed and being understood.
 *
 * Only fields the database actually holds are emitted. Padding this with a
 * made-up seller rating or review count is misrepresentation in a
 * machine-readable format, which search engines penalise and which would be
 * a lie about a real business.
 *
 * `itemCondition` is emitted now that the listing genuinely records it —
 * this used to be named here as an example of what *not* to invent, and the
 * rule has not changed: it is here because there is a column behind it, and
 * it maps to schema.org's vocabulary rather than sending our own enum name
 * out to a consumer that would not recognise it.
 *
 * The JSON is serialised with `JSON.stringify` and the one character that
 * could close the script element early is escaped. Every value here is
 * operator-entered, so it is not attacker-controlled, but a model name
 * containing `</script>` would break the page regardless of intent.
