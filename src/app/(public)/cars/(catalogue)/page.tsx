/**
 * The public vehicle catalogue.
 *
 * ── Where the vehicles come from ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `listPublishedVehicles`, never the admin `listVehicles`. That module
 * applies no status filter by default — correct for a dashboard, where an
 * operator has to be able to find a vehicle they archived last month, and
 * catastrophic here, where it would put unfinished drafts and vehicles
 * already sold in front of customers at prices nobody meant to publish.
 * Nothing on this page is hard-coded: an operator publishes a listing and
 * it appears, which is the brief's central technical requirement.
 *
 * ── Searching and filtering (Stage 12) ────────────────────────────────
 * A free-text box matched against make, model and year at once, above
 * dropdowns for the same three fields. The two combine rather than compete.
 * The whole search lives in the query string: it is parsed by
 * `vehicleSearchSchema` on every request, so a filtered catalogue is a real
 * address a customer can bookmark or send over WhatsApp, and the back button
 * works. Nothing about the search state is held in a component.
 *
 * The brief's wider list — price, mileage, fuel, transmission, drive,
 * location — is scoped out of Wave A at the client's request. It is not
 * designed around: `PublicVehicleFilters` still accepts any of them, so each
 * is a field on the schema plus a control on the bar, not a rewrite.

/**
 * Metadata that knows whether a filter is applied.
 *
 * ── Why the canonical always points at /cars ──────────────────────────
 * Three filters produce a large number of URLs over the same inventory, and
 * a search engine that indexes them all sees near-duplicate pages competing
 * with each other for the terms the business actually wants to rank for
 * ("Cars for sale in South Sudan", "Japan cars South Sudan"). Pointing every
 * filtered view at the unfiltered catalogue consolidates that signal on one
 * page. Individual vehicle pages remain separately indexable, which is where
 * the long-tail search value genuinely lives.
 *
 * The *title* still reflects the filter, because it is what a customer sees
 * in a browser tab and in a WhatsApp link preview — and "Toyota Harrier 2021
 * for sale in South Sudan" is a far more useful thing to receive than
 * "Cars".

          The catalogue runs to the wide measure, and the grid is four
          columns from `xl`.

          It used to be three columns inside a 72rem cap, which gave a 371px
          card — the width the card's specification band was measured
          against. Four columns at that cap would be 273px each, well under
          the 328px at which the band gives up and drops the Explore cue onto
          its own line, so the width has to come from somewhere. `Container
          size="wide"` is 100rem, which at four columns and a 20px gutter
          gives roughly 385px on a 1920px display and 361px at 1600px — the
          same measure the three-column layout had, at one more car per row.

          The floor is the `xl` breakpoint itself: 1280px yields a 281px
          card, which is the tightest arrangement here and still a supported
          one (the card's container queries close its gaps up and, below
          328px, stack the cue — the same thing the "You may also like" strip
          does at phone widths, so a row of them stays uniform). Do not move
          the fourth column below `xl` without re-measuring: at `lg` the
          cards fall under 240px and the band has nowhere left to go.

          The container sits on the whole block — count, grid and pagination
          — rather than on the grid alone, so the three stay aligned with
          each other instead of the grid floating inside a narrower header.
          The masthead above is centred text, so it needs no matching change.
