/**
 * A single spare part.
 *
 * ── Visibility ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `getPublishedSparePartBySlug` looks the slug up *with* the PUBLISHED clause
 * rather than by unique key, so a draft or an archived part is
 * indistinguishable from a slug that never existed — this page cannot leak
 * one by forgetting to check, because there is nothing here to remember. The
 * query is `cache()`d, so `generateMetadata` and the page body share a single
 * database round trip.
 *
 * ── Shape of the page ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     ← Back to spare parts                          [ 🛒 3 ]
 *     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *                      │  brand · category
 *                      │  Front brake pad set
 *       gallery        │  04465-48150
 *       (sticky)       │  $120 est.
 *                      │  fits …
 *                      │  [ add to cart ] [ whatsapp ]
 *                      │  ─────────────────────────────
 *                      │  about this part
 *     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *     you may also like
 *
 * The gallery sits beside the decision rather than above it, which is the
 * opposite of the vehicle page — and deliberately. A car is bought on how it
 * looks and the photograph deserves the full measure; a part is bought on
 * whether it fits, and the fitment list has to be visible at the same moment
 * as the photograph confirming it is the right shape.
 *
 * ── Why the description is in that column and not its own band ────────
 * It used to be a full-width section of its own below the fold, and that put
 * the two halves of one answer — what the part looks like, and what it is —
 * a scroll apart. Reading the description then meant scrolling back up to
 * check it against the photograph, on a phone, repeatedly. Keeping it in the
 * decision column means the gallery is still on screen while it is read; the
 * gallery is `sticky` from `lg` for exactly that reason, so a long
 * description scrolls past a photograph that stays put.
 *
 * ── What this page does not show ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Condition, country of origin, stock, whether the price is fixed or quoted,
 * and anything about sourcing — at the dealership's instruction. The DTO does
 * not carry any of them, so there is nothing here to render by accident.
 *
 * Our own `CLM-SP-…` listing reference is not shown either, at the same
 * instruction: a customer identifies a part by the manufacturer's number
 * stamped on the one they are replacing, and a second internal-looking code
 * beside it is noise. It is still what the WhatsApp message quotes, because
 * an OEM number legitimately appears on several listings and the operator
 * receiving that message has to be able to open exactly one.

                The eyebrow read "DENSO · Brakes" in gold at the top of the

/**
 * Structured data for the listing.
 *
 * A `Product` with an `Offer`, which is what lets a search engine show the
 * price against the result — the brief asks for individually indexable part
 * pages, and this is the difference between being indexed and being
 * understood.
 *
 * Only fields the database actually holds are emitted. Padding this with a
 * made-up rating or review count is misrepresentation in a machine-readable
 * format, which search engines penalise and which would be a lie about a real
 * business.
 *
 * ── Two deliberate omissions ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `availability` is absent. schema.org's vocabulary here is `InStock` /
 * `OutOfStock`, and the catalogue does not publish stock levels — emitting
 * either would put a claim in front of a crawler that the page itself does
 * not make.
 *
 * A part priced on enquiry emits no `offers` block at all rather than a price
 * of zero, which a search engine would happily render as "$0.00".
 *
 * Serialised through `serializeJsonLd`, which escapes everything that could
 * close the script element early. Every value here is operator-entered, but
 * a part name containing `</script>` would otherwise break out of it.
