/**
 * The public spare-parts catalogue.
 *
 * ── Where the parts come from ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `listPublishedSpareParts`, never the admin `listSpareParts`. That module
 * applies no status filter by default — correct for a dashboard, where an
 * operator has to be able to find a part they archived last month, and
 * catastrophic here, where it would put unfinished drafts and withdrawn
 * listings in front of customers at prices nobody meant to publish. It also
 * selects the supplier fields, which are internal sourcing records.
 *
 * Nothing on this page is hard-coded: an operator publishes a part and it
 * appears, which is the brief's central technical requirement.
 *
 * ── The shape of the page ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     ← Home │ Spare Parts
 *     ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *          ╭─────────── search ───────────╮ ( → )        ← sticky
 *      All parts   Brakes   Suspension   …
 *     ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *                                         48 parts available
 *     the grid
 *     pagination
 *     recently viewed
 *
 * One utility row, then one sticky toolbar holding both ways of narrowing the
 * grid, then products. The centred masthead that used to open this page — a
 * breadcrumb trail, a headline and a line of positioning copy — is gone: it
 * cost most of the first screen on a phone to say things a customer browsing
 * parts did not come for. The keywords it carried live in `generateMetadata`
 * and on the individual part pages, which is where the long-tail search value
 * actually is. The BreadcrumbList structured data is still emitted below,
 * with the visible trail suppressed.
 *
 * The search box used to sit in a bordered block above the grid, which meant
 * it scrolled away while the sticky category rail stayed — so a customer at
 * the bottom of a twenty-four card page could change category but not their
 * search term. Both now live in `SparePartsCatalogueBar` and both stay
 * reachable the whole way down.
 *
 * Categories and the search term live entirely in the query string, so a
 * filtered catalogue is a real address that can be bookmarked or sent over
 * WhatsApp, and the back button works.
 *
 * ── What the catalogue deliberately does not show ─────────────────────
 * Condition, country of origin, whether a part is priced or quoted, stock
 * levels, and anything about sourcing. Those are operational facts the
 * dashboard shows and a customer does not need; the public DTOs do not carry
 * them at all, so no component here could render one by accident. See the
 * module note in public-spare-part.queries.ts.

/**
 * Metadata that knows whether a filter is applied.
 *
 * ── Why the canonical always points at /spare-parts ───────────────────
 * A category and a search term produce a large number of URLs over the same
 * catalogue, and a search engine that indexes them all sees near-duplicate
 * pages competing with each other for the terms the business wants to rank
 * for ("Toyota spare parts South Sudan", "Japanese car spare parts Juba").
 * Pointing every filtered view at the unfiltered catalogue consolidates that
 * signal. Individual part pages remain separately indexable, which is where
 * the long-tail search value genuinely lives.
 *
 * The *title* still reflects the category, because it is what a customer sees
 * in a browser tab and in a WhatsApp link preview.
