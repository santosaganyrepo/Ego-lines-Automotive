 * Public-site error boundary.
 *
 * Must be a client component — Next.js requires it, since `reset` is a
 * callback that re-renders the failed segment in place.
 *
 * `error.message` is deliberately never shown. In production Next.js
 * already redacts server errors down to a digest, but on the client a raw
 * message can still leak internal detail, and a stack trace is meaningless
 * to a customer trying to track a vehicle. The digest is surfaced instead:
 * it is safe to display and it is what lets staff find the matching
 * server-side log entry.
