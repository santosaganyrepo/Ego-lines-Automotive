 * supplies, a short introduction linking to About Us, why
 * buy here, how importing works, spare parts, the questions buyers ask, and a
 * last invitation to ask for the car they did not find.
 *

 * the dashboard's "Feature on the homepage" switches, and every contact
 * action from Settings, so the page changes when
 * the business does without anyone editing it.
