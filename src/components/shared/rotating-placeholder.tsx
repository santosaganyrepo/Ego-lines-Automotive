/**
 * A placeholder that cycles through the things people actually search for.
 *
 * ── What it is for ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An empty search box is a question with no examples. "Part name or number"
 * describes the field; it does not tell a customer that typing half a
 * stamping off an old casting will work, or that the box understands a model
 * name as readily as a part number. Showing real examples, one after another,
 * teaches the control in the two seconds someone spends deciding whether to
 * use it — which on a catalogue with a search-first layout is the difference
 * between a customer searching and a customer scrolling.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the `placeholder` attribute ───────────────────────
 * A native placeholder cannot be animated: swapping the attribute makes the
 * text jump, with no way to cross-fade between two values. So the visible
 * placeholder is a real element layered over the field, and the input's own
 * `placeholder` is set to a single space by the caller.
 *
 * That space is load-bearing. `:placeholder-shown` only matches when a
 * placeholder attribute is actually present and the field is empty, and it is
 * what hides this overlay the moment somebody types — in CSS, with no state
 * and no re-render per keystroke. An empty attribute would never match and the
 * overlay would sit on top of the customer's own text.
 *
 * ── It degrades to a plain placeholder ────────────────────────────────
 * The server renders the first suggestion, and so does the first client
 * render — so there is no hydration mismatch, and with JavaScript unavailable
 * or still loading the field shows one honest example rather than nothing. The
 * rotation is the enhancement; the first frame is the baseline.
 *
 * ── Motion ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A short rise-and-fade per swap, at the design system's own timings, on a
 * four-second dwell. Fast enough to read, slow enough that the eye is not
 * pulled back to it — the brief's "the user should never think *that website
 * has lots of animations*". It stops entirely while the field has focus: once
 * somebody is typing, a moving hint beside the caret is a distraction, not a
 * suggestion. `prefers-reduced-motion` pins it to the first suggestion.
