/**
 * A horizontally scrolling strip of cards — vehicles or spare parts.
 *
 * Product-agnostic by construction: the cards arrive as `children`, already
 * rendered on the server, and the heading arrives as a prop. Nothing here
 * knows what is inside a card, which is why both catalogues use it rather
 * than each growing a scroller of its own.
 *
 * ── Why a scroller rather than a grid ─────────────────────────────────
 * A grid of related vehicles has to decide, at build time, how many
 * vehicles are worth showing — and whatever it picks is wrong for a
 * business whose inventory swings between two Toyotas and twenty. A strip
 * shows as many as exist, sizes itself to whatever room the page has, and
 * asks the customer for the one gesture they already make on a phone.
 * Swipe on touch, drag or arrows on a desktop.
 *
 * ── Native scrolling, not a carousel library ──────────────────────────
 * This is `overflow-x: auto` with CSS scroll snapping. The browser owns
 * the momentum, the rubber-banding, the trackpad gesture and the
 * right-to-left case; a JavaScript carousel reimplements all four and gets
 * at least one of them wrong on a mid-range Android, which is most of this
 * audience. The only thing script adds here is the two arrow buttons and
 * knowing when to disable them — and if that script never loads, the strip
 * still scrolls perfectly by touch and trackpad.
 *
 * The cards are passed in as `children` and the heading as a prop, both
 * rendered on the server. That is deliberate: this component is a client
 * island because it needs a scroll listener, and pushing the cards through
 * it would drag `next/image`, the card, the badge and four icons into the
 * client bundle to render markup that never changes.
 *
 * ── Accessibility ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every card is a link, so a keyboard user tabs through the strip and the
 * browser scrolls each card into view on focus — the content is reachable
 * without the arrows, which is why the arrows are genuinely optional and
 * hidden entirely on touch widths. The strip keeps its list semantics and
 * takes an accessible name, so it is announced as a named list of a known
 * length rather than as loose links. `aria-live` is deliberately absent:
 * nothing here announces, it just scrolls.

        while the last one runs off the edge instead of stopping short of
        it. `scroll-px` keeps snapping honest against that padding.

        The scrollbar is hidden because the cards do the work a scrollbar
        would: they are sized so the next one always peeks past the edge,
        which says "there is more" more clearly than a 6px track.
