/**
 * The spare-parts basket, and the confirmation it shows.
 *
 * ── Why the basket lives in the browser ───────────────────────────────
 * Adding a part commits the customer to nothing: no row is written, no stock
 * is held, no price is locked. It is a shortlist. Wave A has no customer
 * accounts, so there is no one to attach a server-side basket *to* — and
 * inventing an anonymous-session table to hold it would be a second commerce
 * store beside the one the schema already defines, which is the thing the
 * architecture is explicitly built to avoid.
 *
 * `localStorage` is therefore the right home: it survives a reload and a
 * closed tab, it costs no round trip on a connection where round trips are
 * the expensive part, and it disappears with the browser it belongs to. When
 * customer accounts arrive (Wave B), this provider is where a basket gets
 * synced to the account — the components above it ask for `useCart()` and
 * would not change.
 *
 * ── What this component actually owns ─────────────────────────────────
 * Not the items. Those live in `lib/cart/cart-store.ts` and are read through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, which is the API for state that lives outside React
 * — see the note there for why an effect that reads storage and calls
 * `setState` is the wrong shape for this.
 *
 * What this owns is the confirmation. "Added to cart" is announced here
 * rather than by each button, so one live region exists on the page instead
 * of one per card: twenty-four polite live regions is how a screen reader
 * ends up announcing nothing at all.
