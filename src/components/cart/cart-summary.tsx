/**
 * What is in the basket, and the one thing to do with it.
 *
 * ── Why this is a panel and not a page ────────────────────────────────
 * A basket page is a step in a checkout, and there is no checkout: an order
 * in this system is created when a quotation is accepted, not when a customer
 * presses a button (see the schema documentation on `Quote` → `Order`).
 * Building a `/cart` route now would be the front half of a purchase flow
 * whose back half deliberately does not exist, and the first thing a customer
 * would do on it is look for a Checkout button.
 *
 * So the basket is a shortlist with a panel to review it, and its one action
 * is the action the business actually supports today: turn this into a
 * quotation. "Request items" switches this same panel to the request form,
 * with every part and quantity already filled in — one panel, two steps,
 * rather than a second modal stacked on the first. When spare-parts checkout
 * is built (Wave B), this is where it gains a second button — nothing about
 * how items are held has to change.
 *
 * A successful request empties the basket: the list *became* the quotation,
 * and leaving it behind would invite the same request twice.
 *
 * ── Why the button hides itself until the basket is read ──────────────
 * `ready` is false until `localStorage` has been read in an effect. Rendering
 * "0" first and then flicking to "3" is worse than rendering nothing for a
 * frame, and the count is the only reason this control exists.
 *
 * That silence is also what makes it safe to mount in the site header, on
 * every public page: a visitor who has never added a part sees no cart glyph
 * at all, so nothing on a page about cars suggests a car goes in a basket.

   *
   * The badge does not change: it is gold on both, which is legible on either
   * surface and is the one part of this control that should stay constant,
   * because the number is the whole point of it.
