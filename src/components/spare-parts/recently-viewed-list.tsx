/**
 * The whole viewing history, as a grid.
 *
 * The strip on a part page shows the most recent handful; this is what its
 * "see all" link reaches. Same tiles, laid out as a grid rather than a
 * scroller, because here the list is the page rather than a band at the
 * bottom of one.
 *
 * ── Three states, and they are genuinely different ────────────────────
 *   not yet read  — storage has not been touched. Render nothing: an empty
 *                   state that flicks to six tiles a frame later is worse
 *                   than a frame of nothing, and this is reachable directly
 *                   from a bookmark where that frame is the whole page.
 *   read, empty   — a new browser, cleared site data, or a customer who has
 *                   cleared the list. Say so, and offer the catalogue.
 *   read, full    — the grid.
 *
 * ── Clearing it ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Offered because this is the customer's own data and a shared or borrowed
 * phone is the normal case in this market, not an edge one. It writes to
 * their browser and nowhere else — there is nothing on our side to delete —
 * so it takes effect immediately and needs no confirmation beyond being an
 * ordinary, clearly-labelled control set apart from the grid.
