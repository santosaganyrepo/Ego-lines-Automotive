/**
 * What a listing says about getting hold of the part.
 *
 * ── One component, three surfaces ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The catalogue card, the part page and the dashboard list all state this,
 * and all three have to agree on the words *and* the colour. A tag that read
 * "In stock" in green on the website and "Available" in grey on the dashboard
 * would have an operator confidently telling a customer something the page in
 * front of them does not say.
 *
 * ── Why the label is not the only signal, and not only the colour ─────
 * The colour groups six states into four answers to one question — can I have
 * it soon, or do I need to talk to someone. The label carries the precise
 * meaning. Neither alone is enough: colour alone fails anyone who cannot
 * distinguish the hues, and a label alone is invisible in a grid being
 * scanned rather than read. The dot is a third, non-colour cue for the
 * positive states.
 *
 * ── No gold ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The brief reserves gold for the actions a customer takes. A grid of
 * twenty-four cards each wearing a gold tag would put gold at every scroll
 * position, which is the one place that rule is easiest to break and hardest
 * to notice having broken.

/**
 * The overlay treatment: one plate, four dot colours.
 *
 * ── Why the pill loses its colour here ────────────────────────────────
 * On the card this tag used to be a filled, coloured, bordered pill sitting
 * in the detail block directly above the part's name — and at that size and
 * weight it won. A grid of twenty-four cards read as twenty-four green
 * badges, with the product names as the quiet second thing. The tag was
 * shouting a fact the customer had not asked for yet.
 *
 * Over the photograph it only has to be *findable*, not loud. So the plate is
 * always the same neutral frosted white and only a 6px dot carries the state,
 * which is the smallest mark that can still be scanned down a column. The
 * label stays in near-black at the smallest step on the scale.
 *
 * The dot is not the only carrier — the words "In stock" are right beside it,
 * so nothing here depends on distinguishing the hues.
