/**
 * "How your part reaches you" — the small trust section on a part page.
 *
 * ── The problem it solves ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A customer in Juba is being asked to commit money to a part that is
 * currently in Japan, on a website belonging to a company they have not
 * bought from before. Everything else on the page argues that we have the
 * right part; nothing on it argues that the part will arrive. This is the
 * four sentences that do.
 *
 * The brief is direct about this: trust is the central problem the site has
 * to solve, and the way to solve it is to make the process explicit rather
 * than to assert that the company is trustworthy.
 *
 * ── Why it is small, and inside the page rather than a band ───────────
 * It is reassurance beside a decision, not a chapter. The full vehicle import
 * story has its own page and its own eight-stage timeline with photography;
 * reproducing that here would bury the price and the fitment under a
 * narrative nobody scrolled to a brake pad to read. Four short steps in a
 * bordered block, directly under the buy controls, is the size of the job.
 *
 * ── Why these steps are configurable and the vehicle ones are not ─────
 * The vehicle timeline mirrors `TrackingStatus`, which shipment records
 * actually key on — changing it would mean changing what the database
 * records. This is copy: it describes how the business handles parts, which
 * is exactly the thing that will be reworded long before it is reworked. So
 * it lives in `BusinessSettings` and an operator edits it in Settings without
 * a deploy. See `spare-part-delivery.ts` for the fallback.
 *
 * ── Colour ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The numerals are gold on a tinted ground, and that is the only colour in
 * the block. It is one of the places gold genuinely earns its 10%: a numbered
 * sequence is exactly the "small separator, important accent" use the brief
 * reserves it for, and it visually links this block to the brand rather than
 * to the buy button above it. A coloured card per step, or an icon set, would
 * turn a reassurance into an infographic.
