/**
 * The catalogue's own toolbar: search and categories, in one sticky band.
 *
 * ── Why the two are one thing ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * They are the two ways into the same result set — "I know the number" and "I
 * know roughly what area it is in" — and they used to be in two different
 * places: the rail pinned under the header, the search box in a bordered block
 * halfway down the page. So the search scrolled away while the categories
 * stayed, and a customer at the bottom of a twenty-four card page could change
 * category but not the term.
 *
 * ── Two layouts, one of everything ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   from `sm`        the pill runs across the top, categories beneath it
 *
 *   below `sm`       ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
 *                    │ All parts  Brakes  Engine …  (🔍)│
 *                    └──────────────────────────────────┘
 *                    the categories take the row, with the magnifier
 *                    pinned at its end; pressing it slides the pill over
 *                    the row
 *
 * A phone has one row of space here, and giving a permanent full-width field
 * the whole of it pushed the categories — the thing someone with a broken car
 * actually browses by — off the first screen. Collapsed to a glyph, the search
 * costs 36px and stays reachable the entire way down the grid, because the
 * band it lives in is sticky.
 *
 * ── The search field is rendered exactly once ─────────────────────────
 * Not once for mobile and once for desktop. Two copies would mean two inputs
 * named `q` in the DOM sharing one accessible name, which is a real
 * navigation defect for a screen-reader user and doubles the markup on the
 * connection least able to afford it. The single instance is positioned
 * differently at the two sizes: static in the flow from `sm`, absolutely
 * placed over the category row when it is open on a phone.
 *
 * The same applies to the rail, which is why the toggle sits *inside* the
 * category row rather than the row being duplicated to make space for it.
 *
 * ── Why this is a Client Component when it used to be a Server one ────
 * The collapse is state. It is a thin one — a boolean, a toggle and an Escape
 * handler — and the rail beneath it still ships no JavaScript of its own,
 * because it is plain links rendered as children.

   *
   * ── Why it does *not* open itself when a search is applied ────────────
   * It did, on the reasoning that arriving at `/spare-parts?q=brake` with the
   * box collapsed hides the thing that produced the results on screen. But on
   * a phone the open field takes the row the categories live on — so
   * auto-opening left a customer who had searched unable to reach a single
   * category until they worked out to close a box they had never opened.
   * Narrowing by category is the more common of the two gestures, so it wins
   * the row by default.
   *
   * The applied term is not hidden, it is just not given a whole row: the
   * toggle wears a gold dot while a search is in effect, and pressing it
   * opens the field with that term in it.
