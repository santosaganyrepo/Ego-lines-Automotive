/**
 * How a part's price is written, everywhere it appears.
 *
 * ── One component so three surfaces cannot disagree ───────────────────
 * The card, the quick-view panel and the part page all state a price, and all
 * three have to make the same two things true: a listed figure is green (the
 * same treatment money already has on a vehicle card, so a customer moving
 * between the two catalogues meets one house style), and it is marked as an
 * estimate.
 *
 * ── Why every price is an estimate ────────────────────────────────────
 * At the dealership's instruction, and for the same reason the vehicle page
 * refuses to publish a delivered total: what a customer finally pays depends
 * on shipping, clearing and where in South Sudan they are collecting, none of
 * which the catalogue knows. A figure a customer budgets against and the
 * business cannot honour is the most expensive thing this site could publish,
 * because it is quoted back at collection.
 *
 * So the estimate marker is not decoration and is not optional — it is part
 * of the price. It is rendered as a separate, quieter word rather than folded
 * into the figure, so the number stays scannable in a grid.
 *
 * ── A part with no listed price ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Rendered as "Price on enquiry". That is a fact about this listing, not the
 * name of an internal pricing mode — the public DTOs do not carry
 * `pricingMode` at all (see public-spare-part.queries.ts), so `price === null`
 * is the only thing this component can see, and the only thing it needs to.

        The lead clause is load-bearing and was briefly dropped.

        On the part page this sits under a red ESTIMATE tag, so "prices are
        estimates" reads as a restatement — which is why it was trimmed. But
        the same component is the *only* explanation on the catalogue, where
        the nearest marker is a two-letter "est." beside each figure. Removing
        the subject left that page with a sentence about shipping and nothing
        saying what the prices actually were.

        A little redundancy on the page that matters most is the right trade:
        the tag is the flag, this is the reason.

/**
 * The word "Estimate", said in full and in red, beside the price on a part
 * page.
 *
 * ── Why this is louder than the "est." on a card ──────────────────────
 * A card's job is to get a customer to the part; the part page is where they
 * decide to spend money, and it is the last screen before they message a
 * business in another country about wiring some. That is the moment a figure
 * has to be unmistakably provisional.
 *
 * The abbreviation is right on a card, where twenty-four of them have to stay
 * scannable. Here it is spelled out: "est." is a convention a used-car buyer
 * knows and a first-time customer reading a second language does not, and the
 * one thing this label must not do is fail to be understood.
 *
 * ── Why red, when nothing has gone wrong ──────────────────────────────
 * Red is the site's caution colour and this is the one genuine caution on the
 * page — the brief is explicit that a price a customer budgets against and
 * the business cannot honour is the most expensive thing this site could
 * publish, because it gets quoted back at collection. Using the destructive
 * token rather than a new colour keeps it inside the palette and inside the
 * theme.
 *
 * It is deliberately a *tint*, not a filled alert: `bg-destructive/10` with
 * destructive text is a quiet flag beside a figure, where a solid red block
 * would read as an error on the listing itself.
 *
 * Rendered only where there is a figure to qualify — a part priced on enquiry
 * has no number for this to be about, and the words "Price on enquiry" are
 * already their own answer.
