/**
 * The parts catalogue grid.
 *
 * Two columns on a phone — the cards are small enough to read side by side,
 * and a parts customer is comparing rather than admiring. Three from `sm`,
 * four only from `xl`.
 *
 * ── Why the fourth column waits for `xl` ──────────────────────────────
 * It used to arrive at `lg`, which put four ~14rem cards across a 1024px
 * laptop. At that width the photograph is a thumbnail and the four rows of
 * detail beneath it are set in the smallest steps the type scale has — a grid
 * that reads as a spreadsheet rather than a catalogue. Holding three columns
 * until 1280px gives each card around 19rem, which is where the photograph
 * becomes something a buyer can actually identify a part from.
 *
 * ── The gutters ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Tighter than the vehicle grid's, and deliberately so. A parts catalogue is
 * scanned rather than admired: the cards now carry a full-bleed photograph
 * with a hard edge, so a narrow gutter reads as an organised rack instead of
 * letting each card float. The vehicle grid keeps its wider gutter because a
 * car photograph is a composed scene that needs room around it.
 *
 * ── Why the stagger stops after the first row ─────────────────────────
 * Each card is revealed with a delay derived from its position, taken modulo
 * the row width. A delay that kept growing down a twenty-four card page would
 * leave the last card waiting most of a second after entering view, which
 * reads as a slow site rather than an elegant one.
 *
 * The reveal degrades correctly on its own: the hidden starting state in
 * globals.css is scoped to `(scripting: enabled)` and
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.
