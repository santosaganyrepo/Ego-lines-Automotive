/**
 * The photograph gallery on a part's page.
 *
 * ── Why this is a client component and the rest of the page is not ────
 * Everything else about a part page is content that never changes after
 * render, so it stays on the server. Choosing which photograph to look at is
 * genuine local state, and isolating it here keeps the description, the
 * fitment table and the structured data out of the browser bundle entirely.
 *
 * ── Why the photographs are contained, not cropped ────────────────────
 * The frame is a padded plinth and every image sits inside it whole. A part
 * arrives photographed however the supplier sent it — a long exhaust section
 * in landscape, a filter shot square, a loom photographed portrait — and
 * `object-cover` would trim whichever dimension did not fit, which on a part
 * is routinely the end that identifies it. The same treatment is on the
 * catalogue card, so the photograph a customer opened is the photograph they
 * see.
 *
 * ── Why every photograph is in the DOM ────────────────────────────────
 * Rather than swapping one `src`. The non-selected frames are hidden but
 * present, so the browser decodes the next image before it is asked for and
 * moving through the gallery does not flash a blank frame on a slow
 * connection. Only the first is eager; the rest carry `loading="lazy"`, so
 * the cost is deferred until the viewer reaches them.
 *
 * ── A thumbnail strip, not arrows ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The vehicle gallery uses arrows because a walk-around can run to forty
 * frames and a strip of forty thumbnails is its own scrolling problem. A part
 * holds at most ten, which fits as a strip on every screen — and a strip is
 * better here, because the frames of a part are *different things* (the unit,
 * its markings, the box) rather than positions around one object, so being
 * able to go straight to the one you want beats stepping through them.
 *
 * The thumbnails behave like a tablist but are marked up as plain buttons
 * with `aria-pressed`. A tablist commits to arrow-key roving focus and a
 * matching set of panels; this is a single panel whose contents change, and
 * claiming the richer pattern without implementing it is worse for a
 * screen-reader user than describing what is actually here.
