 *     └─────────────────────────┘
 *
 * ── What the eye is meant to land on ──────────────────────────────────
 * The part's name, and nothing else. Everything on a card competes for that,
 * and two things were beating it:
 *
 *   The availability tag was a filled, coloured, bordered pill sitting
 *   directly above the name. Twenty-four cards read as twenty-four green
 *   badges. It now sits over the photograph as a quiet frosted plate with a
 *   6px coloured dot (see the tag's `overlay` variant) — still findable at a
 *   glance, no longer the first thing seen.
 *
 *   The brand was a gold eyebrow above the name, and gold above near-black is
 *   never the second thing read. It has gone from the card entirely and lives
 *   on the part's page, where "By: Denso" is one clean line in a specification
 *   block. A brand is a reassurance while deciding, not a way of telling two
 *   cards apart in a grid — the *name* does that.
 *
 * The name itself is now semibold at the body step rather than medium at the
 * small step, which is the change that makes the grid scannable.
 *
 * ── Why `object-cover` ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The photograph runs to the card's edges and fills the frame. Contain would
 * letterbox every listing inside margins of five different shapes — the exact
 * opposite of the brief's photography standard, which asks for one consistent
 * aspect ratio across every card. The cropping that risks is handled where it
 * belongs: the preview panel and the part's own page both show the whole
 * photograph, uncropped. A card's job is to be recognised, not inspected.
 *
 * ── Two targets, one card ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pressing the card opens the part. Pressing the gold cart button opens the
 * preview panel, where the customer can see the part properly and add it
 * without losing their place in the grid.
 *
 * That is two controls in one card, and the markup has to be careful: a
 * `<button>` inside an `<a>` is invalid, and browsers resolve it by making one
 * of the two unreachable. So the card is not an anchor. The title is the
 * anchor, stretched over the whole card with `after:absolute after:inset-0`;
 * the button is raised above that overlay with `relative z-10`. One tab stop
 * each, and a real accessible name on both.

/**
 * The gold cart button, opposite the price.
 *
 * ── Why it moved off the photograph ───────────────────────────────────
 * It used to float in the corner of the image, which put a control on top of
 * the one thing on the card that has to be read as a photograph, and gave the
 * card two competing focal points. In the detail block, opposite the price, it
 * reads as what it is: the action that belongs to that figure. It also stops
 * covering part of the product on a card where the crop is already tight.
 *
 * ── The glyph ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A shopping cart, at the dealership's instruction. It was a bare `+`, on the
 * argument that a plus promises "one more step" — which is literally what
 * happens — where a cart promises a completed purchase.
 *
 * That argument was thinner than it looked. A `+` beside a price is the most
 * overloaded glyph in interface design: it is "add to basket" on one site,
 * "compare" on the next and "expand" on the third, and a first-time visitor on
 * a phone has to press it to find out which. A cart is the one mark in this
 * whole grid that a customer in this market reads without thinking, and it
 * names the destination of the flow the button starts. The half-step it
 * skips — the preview panel — is not a surprise to anyone who pressed it, it
 * is the panel that lets them check the fitment before committing.
 *
 * ── What it does ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Opens the preview panel — it does not add silently. A card is a thumbnail, a
 * name and a price, which is enough to be interested in a part and not enough
 * to be sure of one; a parts buyer's real question is whether the component
 * fits their car, and getting that wrong costs them an import. So the button
 * opens the part at a size where the photograph, the fitment and the
 * description answer it, with the real Add control inside.
 *
 * The accessible name says exactly that — see `aria-label` below — so the
 * glyph is never the only thing telling a customer what will happen.
 *
 * ── Hidden on a pointer, always there on a touchscreen ────────────────
 * On a device with a real pointer the button fades in when the card is
 * hovered, which keeps the grid clean and lets the photography carry it. A
 * touchscreen has no hover, and a control revealed by one does not exist on a
 * phone — where most of this business's customers are. So the resting state is
 * gated on `@media (hover: hover)`, the query that actually asks "can this
 * device hover", rather than on a width breakpoint, which guesses and gets
 * touch laptops and small windows wrong in both directions.
 *
 * `group-focus-within` covers the third case: a keyboard user tabbing to the
 * button has not hovered anything, and a control that is focused but invisible
 * is the worst of the three states.
