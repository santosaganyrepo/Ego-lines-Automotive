 * Search for the parts catalogue.

 *
 * One pill, fully rounded at both ends, with the submit as a filled circle
 * riding at the end of it. That is the arrangement a customer in this market
 * already has in their hands on every marketplace they use, and it is why it
 * is worth copying: a search field should be recognised, not learned.
 *
 * It replaced a rectangular field beside a rectangular labelled button, which
 * read as one more form control on a page and, sitting inside a bordered
 * block above the grid, as a card. This is a bar — it sits in the sticky band
 * with the categories, so it stays reachable the whole way down the
 * catalogue rather than scrolling away with the top of the page.
 *
 * ── One box, three columns ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The term is matched against the part name, the manufacturer's number and
 * our own reference at once, so someone holding a worn part can type whatever
 * is legible on it without first deciding which kind of number it is. The
 * category rail beside it narrows the same result set; the two are ANDed by
 * the query layer.
 *
 * Deliberately simpler than the vehicle catalogue's bar, which also carries
 * make/model/year dropdowns. Parts are found by name or by number; a set of
 * dropdowns over a catalogue of consumables would be three more controls to
 * read past on a phone for a narrowing nobody asked for. Fitment filtering
 * ("show me parts for my Harrier") is a real requirement and a different
 * control — it belongs beside a vehicle, not in this box.
 *
 * ── Why a real GET form, not an onChange-only widget ──────────────────
 * It is a `<form action="/spare-parts" method="get">` around one input. That
 * has three consequences worth having:
 *
 *   1. It works with JavaScript unavailable or still loading — which on a 2G
 *      connection in Juba is a real state, not a hypothetical one. The
 *      browser submits the form and the server renders the filtered page.
 *   2. The result is a URL, so a search can be bookmarked and shared.
 *   3. The back button behaves.
 *
 * The current category travels in a hidden field, so searching inside
 * Suspension stays inside Suspension — the mirror of the rail carrying `q`
 * through a category change.
 *
 * ── Why the input is uncontrolled ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A controlled input is hydrated with the value the *server* rendered, and
 * React overwrites whatever is in the field to match. Anything typed between
 * the HTML arriving and the bundle hydrating is silently erased — on a slow
 * connection that is not a race, it is a wait long enough to type a part
 * number into a box that is already on screen and looks ready.
 *
 * The URL is still the source of truth: `key` on the field is what enforces
 * it, replacing the input with a fresh one carrying the new value whenever
 * the applied search changes.
