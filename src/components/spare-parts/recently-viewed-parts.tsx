/**
 * "Recently viewed" — the parts this customer has already looked at.
 *
 * ── Where it sits, and why there ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Directly below "More in this category", at the very bottom of a part page.
 * That order is deliberate: the category strip is a *suggestion*, which is
 * the business talking, and this is the customer's own trail back to
 * something they were comparing. Someone who has scrolled past a full listing
 * and a row of suggestions without acting is usually trying to get back to
 * the one they saw two parts ago, and this is the shortest route to it.
 *
 * ── Why it renders nothing on a first visit ───────────────────────────
 * A new customer has no history, and a heading over an empty row would open
 * the page's last impression on something that does not work. It also renders
 * nothing while there is only the current part to show — a "recently viewed"
 * row containing exactly the page you are on is a mirror, not a shortcut.
 *
 * ── The data is the customer's, and never leaves their browser ────────
 * Read through `useSyncExternalStore` from `localStorage` (see
 * `recently-viewed-store.ts`). Nothing is written to the database, nothing is
 * sent anywhere, and it disappears with the browser it belongs to. That is
 * not only a privacy position — it is what lets this render with no query on
 * a page that is already doing three.
 *
 * The entries are snapshots taken when the part was viewed, so a price here
 * can be one visit stale. The card links to the live listing and the card
 * itself says nothing that would commit the business, which is why a
 * shortlist can afford a staleness a catalogue could not.

 * snapshot data that is a visit old. Half the height and no controls is the
 * honest size for "you looked at these".
 *
 * Native horizontal scrolling with snap points, matching `CardCarousel`: two
 * and a bit tiles visible on a phone so the next one peeks past the edge,
 * which is the affordance that says the row scrolls and the reason its
 * scrollbar can be hidden.
 *
 * Exported so the "see all" page can render the same tiles in a grid without

 * ── Why a component rather than a hook on the page ────────────────────
 * The part page is a Server Component — it has to be, for the metadata, the
 * structured data and the visibility-pinned query. It cannot hold an effect.
 * This is the smallest possible client island that can: one effect, no
 * markup, no state, and nothing in the accessibility tree.
 *
 * ── Why an effect and not a call during render ────────────────────────
 * Writing to `localStorage` during render is a side effect in a function
 * React may call twice, discard, or replay. In an effect it runs once per
 * committed navigation, which is exactly the definition of "viewed".
 *
 * The dependency list is the part's own fields rather than the object, so a
 * new object identity from a re-render does not re-record a view that already
 * happened — and a genuine navigation to a different part does.
