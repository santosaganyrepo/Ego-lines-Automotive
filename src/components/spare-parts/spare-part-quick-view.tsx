/**
 * The preview that opens from a card's Add button.
 *
 * ── Why adding goes through a preview at all ──────────────────────────
 * A card is a thumbnail, a name and a price. That is enough to be
 * *interested* in a part and not enough to be sure of one — a parts buyer's
 * real question is "is this the right component for my car", and getting it
 * wrong costs them an import of something that does not fit.
 *
 * So pressing Add does not silently drop the part in the basket. It opens the
 * part at a size where the photograph is legible, the fitment list is
 * readable and the description says what the thing actually is, with the real
 * Add control inside. One press to look, one to commit — and the second press
 * is made with the answer on screen.
 *
 * ── Why a panel rather than a navigation ──────────────────────────────
 * Someone buying parts is usually buying several, and each is a small
 * decision. Sending them to a full page for each and back again loses their
 * place in a grid they may have scrolled a long way down — on a phone, twice
 * per part. The panel answers the same questions in place and puts them back
 * exactly where they were.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* the whole part page: a short excerpt of the
 * description and the first few fitment rules, with a link to the page for
 * the rest. A preview that reproduced the page would be a second
 * implementation of it to keep in step.
 *
 * ── Where its data comes from ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The card it was opened from. Nothing is fetched — see the note on
 * `PREVIEW_PHOTO_LIMIT` in public-spare-part.queries.ts for why half a
 * kilobyte per card beats a request per open on the connections this business
 * runs on. The panel therefore opens instantly, and works for someone whose
 * connection dropped after the page loaded.
 *
 * ── Adding, and what happens after ────────────────────────────────────
 * The button confirms in place for a moment and the panel then closes, so the
 * customer is returned to the grid they were working through rather than
 * being left to dismiss a dialog whose job is done. The spoken confirmation
 * comes from the cart provider's single live region; the header badge
 * increments at the same time.
