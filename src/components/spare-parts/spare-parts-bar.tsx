/**
 * The one utility row at the top of every spare-parts page.
 *
 * ── What it replaced, and why ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A centred "Home › Spare Parts" trail sitting above a centred headline and a
 * line of positioning copy. Three centred bands before the first product, on
 * a page whose entire job is to get a customer to the grid — on a 390px phone
 * that was most of the first screen spent on things nobody came for.
 *
 * What is left is the one control that still does work here: the way back,
 * with the page's name beside it.
 *
 *     ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *     │ ← Home │ Spare Parts                  [🛒 Parts list 3]│
 *     └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * ── The basket lives here ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On the end of this row, on every spare-parts page — the catalogue, a part
 * and the recently-viewed list — beside the parts it holds. It moved here
 * from the site header at the dealership's request: the header is the
 * company's frame on every page, and a basket belongs to the one section
 * where there is something to put in it. `CartSummary` renders nothing until
 * the basket holds something.
 *
 * ── The trail is gone from the screen, not from the page ──────────────
 * Search engines still receive the BreadcrumbList: the catalogue and the part
 * page emit it as JSON-LD via `Breadcrumbs`, rendered with the visible nav
 * suppressed. Losing the SEO along with the visual clutter would have been a
 * silent cost.
