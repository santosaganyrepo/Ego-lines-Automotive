/**
 * The opening band of a catalogue — Cars, and Spare Parts.
 *
 * ── Why both catalogues share one component ───────────────────────────
 * They are the same object: a photograph, the trail, one line of positioning,
 * one line of substance. Two copies would drift the moment either is touched,
 * and the brief is explicit that the parts section must feel like part of the
 * same company rather than a separate website. The differences between them
 * are content, so they are props.
 *
 * ── Why it is short ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Deliberately about two thirds the height of the standard `PageHeader`. A
 * catalogue's whole job is to get a customer to the grid, and on a phone
 * every line here is a line the first card is pushed down by. It is a band
 * with a photograph behind it, not a full-height hero — that treatment
 * belongs to the homepage, which is the one page whose job is to make an
 * impression rather than to answer a question.
 *
 * ── The photograph ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Sits behind a scrim heavy enough that white text clears WCAG AA over any
 * part of it, so a replacement photograph can never quietly break the
 * contrast of the heading on top. `preload` because this is the LCP element
 * on both pages.
