 * white-text transparent variant over a white page — the navigation and
 * the menu trigger disappeared completely. Route-based styling cannot
 * detect that; asking the DOM can.
 *
 * The observer's root is inset from the top by the header's own height, so
 * "intersecting" means precisely "some of the hero is still behind the
 * header". Scrolling the hero away therefore restores the solid variant
 * without a second scroll listener.
 *
 * Returns false until proven otherwise. The solid header is legible on
 * every background, so the safe state is also the initial one — and the
 * only cost when a hero *is* present is that the header resolves to
 * transparent on the first frame after mount, which the background
 * transition absorbs.
