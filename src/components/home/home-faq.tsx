Your quotation shows the amount of each payment, and every payment is checked and confirmed by our team.`,

        "Send us a quote request with the make, model, year and budget you have in mind. We will look for it in Japan, South Korea and China and reply with a full quotation — there is no commitment until you accept it.",

      question: "Do you also supply spare parts?",
