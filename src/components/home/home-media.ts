/**
 * The photographs the homepage is dressed in.
 *
 * Held in one place so replacing them with the dealership's own photography —
 * the brief asks for real vehicles over stock imagery once they exist — is an
 * edit to this file rather than a hunt through the sections. Paths are under
 * /public; `alt` is empty for images that are purely atmospheric.
 *
 * ── Why there is no longer a hero film ────────────────────────────────
 * The hero was a 27MB MP4 held behind a "start on first interaction" gate.
 * On the mobile connections this audience is on it routinely never finished
 * downloading, so the hero sat on its fallback surface and read as broken —
 * and the gate itself depended on pointer events that a touch device does not
 * send. A single optimised photograph is the permanent answer: it is the LCP
 * element, it is preloaded, and Next's optimiser serves it as AVIF/WebP at
 * the size the device actually needs (see next.config.ts).

   * ── Where the file goes ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   *   public/images/home/hero-2.jpg
   *
   * The optimiser caches a variant by URL for up to a month (see
   * `minimumCacheTTL` in next.config.ts), so replacing this file's bytes
   * under the same name would keep serving the old image to every visitor
   * and CDN edge already holding it cached. Give the new file its own name
   * (increment the suffix) and update `src` below to match. What to supply:
   *
   *   • Landscape, at least 2400×1350 (16:9). It is cropped to fill a
   *     full-height panel, so keep the subject away from the extreme edges —
   *     on a phone the frame is close to square and takes the middle.
   *   • The left third sits under the headline and is darkened by the scrim,
   *     so put the car on the right if the composition allows it.
   *   • JPEG, quality ~80, under ~600KB. It does not need to be smaller than
   *     that: the optimiser re-encodes it to AVIF/WebP per device, and the
   *     file in the repo is only the source.
   *
   * `alt` is empty because the photograph is decoration behind the site's
   * own headline — the h1 beside it carries the meaning.
