/**
 * Crownline button.
 *
 * Three rules from the brand brief are encoded here rather than left to
 * each page to remember:
 *
 * 1. Buttons keep a distinct 8px radius while cards and media frames stay
 *    near-square. That contrast in geometry is what makes a button read as
 *    pressable instead of as another information tile — the brief calls
 *    out badge/button confusion as a specific failure to avoid.
 *
 * 2. `default` is the single gold CTA. It is intentionally the only filled
 *    gold variant, so "one primary action per surface" is enforced by the
 *    palette rather than by discipline. Secondary actions take `outline`.
 *
 * 3. The marketing sizes (`lg`, `xl`) set their labels in Manrope, bold,
 *    uppercase, with wide tracking. In this design language a large button
 *    is always a headline call to action — "VIEW CARS", "GET A QUOTE" —
 *    and that treatment is what makes it read as automotive rather than as
 *    a SaaS form control. `xs`/`sm`/`default` stay in Inter, sentence
 *    case, for dense UI and the admin dashboard.
 *
 * Motion: hover raises the button half a step and deepens its shadow;
 * press returns it to the surface. The lift and the shadow are one
 * gesture — a shadow that grows while the element stays put reads as a
 * filter effect, whereas moving both together reads as the object
 * physically rising. How far it rises is `--button-lift`, so the staff
 * dashboard can hold its controls still. Both run at --duration-fast (180ms) per the brief's
 * micro-interaction budget, and the global reduced-motion rule collapses
 * them to near-zero for anyone who has asked for less movement.
 *
 * On dark surfaces the neutral variants are restyled by descendant rules
 * under `[data-tone="dark"]` in globals.css, keyed off the `data-variant`
 * attribute emitted below — so a header, footer or drawer marks itself
 * dark once instead of hand-patching classes onto each button it renders.
