/**
 * Crownline badge.
 *
 * A badge states a fact — "Available", "In transit", "Sold". It is not an
 * action, and the brief singles out badge/button confusion as a specific
 * failure to avoid.
 *
 * Two things keep them apart, and both matter:
 *
 * - Geometry. Badges are full pills; buttons hold a 8px radius. A shape
 *   this round reads as a label, never as something pressable.
 * - Colour. The `default` badge is a gold *tint* with gold ink, not the
 *   solid gold fill. That fill is reserved for the one primary CTA on a
 *   surface — a solid-gold badge sitting beside a solid-gold button makes
 *   the page ambiguous about which of the two can be clicked, which was
 *   exactly the case before.
 *
 * Badges also carry no shadow. Elevation in this system means "this object
 * is raised and interactive"; a flat chip beside a lifted button is a
 * second, quieter signal of the same distinction.
