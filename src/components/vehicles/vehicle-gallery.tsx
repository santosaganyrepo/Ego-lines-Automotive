/**
 * The vehicle photograph gallery.
 *
 * ── Why this is the one client component on the page ──────────────────
 * Everything else about a vehicle page is content that never changes after
 * render, so it stays on the server. Choosing which photograph to look at
 * is genuine local state, and isolating it here keeps the rest of the page
 * — description, specifications, pricing, structured data — out of the
 * browser bundle entirely.
 *
 * ── Why every photograph is in the DOM ────────────────────────────────
 * Rather than swapping one `src`. The non-selected frames are hidden but
 * present, so the browser decodes the next image before it is asked for and
 * moving through a gallery does not flash a blank frame on a slow
 * connection. Only the first is eager; the rest carry `loading="lazy"`, so
 * the cost of that is deferred until the viewer actually reaches it.
 *
 * ── Keyboard and screen-reader shape ──────────────────────────────────
 * The thumbnails are a tablist in behaviour, but they are marked up as
 * plain buttons with `aria-pressed` rather than as an ARIA tablist. A
 * tablist commits to arrow-key roving focus and a matching set of panels;
 * this is a single panel whose contents change, and claiming the richer
 * pattern without implementing it is worse for a screen-reader user than
 * describing what is actually here.
