/**
 * The catalogue grid.
 *
 * ── Why the stagger stops after the first row ─────────────────────────
 * Each card is revealed with a delay derived from its position, but the
 * offset is taken modulo the row width and capped. A delay that keeps
 * growing down a twelve-card page means the last card waits most of a
 * second after entering view, which does not read as elegance — it reads as
 * a slow site, which is the specific failure the brief warns against on
 * mobile connections. Staggering across a row is enough to make the
 * movement feel authored; staggering down a page just makes it late.
 *
 * The reveal itself degrades correctly on its own: the hidden starting
 * state in globals.css is scoped to `(scripting: enabled)` and
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, so a visitor without JavaScript
 * or with reduced motion requested simply sees the cards.
