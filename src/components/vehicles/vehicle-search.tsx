/**
 * Search and filtering for the public catalogue (Stage 12).
 *
 * ── The shape of the search ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two controls, in the order a customer reaches for them:
 *
 *   1. A free-text box. One field matched against make, model and year at
 *      once, so "harrier", "Toyota Harrier" and "harrier 2021" all work
 *      without the customer first deciding which field they mean. Matching
 *      is case-insensitive and partial — see `vehicleSearchWhere`.
 *   2. The make / model / year dropdowns beneath it — the "Toyota →
 *      Harrier → 2021" journey from the brief. Their options are drawn from
 *      the published inventory (`listVehicleFacets`) and narrow as choices
 *      are made, so a customer cannot assemble a search that was never
 *      going to match anything.
 *
 * The two combine rather than compete: the text and the dropdowns are
 * ANDed by the query layer.
 *
 * ── Why a real GET form, not an onChange-only widget ──────────────────
 * The bar is a `<form action="/cars" method="get">` around a text input and
 * three native `<select>`s. That has three consequences worth having, none
 * of them decorative:
 *
 *   1. It works with JavaScript unavailable or still loading — which on a
 *      2G connection in Juba is a real state, not a hypothetical one. The
 *      browser submits the form and the server renders the filtered page.
 *   2. The result is a URL. A filtered catalogue can be bookmarked, shared
 *      over WhatsApp, and re-entered by the back button, because the state
 *      lives in the address rather than in this component.
 *   3. On a phone a native `<select>` opens the platform's own picker —
 *      bigger targets and a familiar gesture, which a custom listbox has to
 *      work hard to match.
 *
 * With JavaScript, changing any select navigates immediately through the
 * router instead, so the page updates without a full reload.
 *
 * ── What this component does not decide ───────────────────────────────
 * Nothing is filtered here. The selections become a query string, and the
 * server re-parses it through `vehicleSearchSchema` on every request. This
 * component cannot widen what a customer sees even if it is wrong.

   * A controlled input is hydrated with the value the *server* rendered,

   * between the HTML arriving and the bundle hydrating is therefore
   * silently erased — which on a 2G connection in Juba is not a race, it is
   * a wait long enough to type a make into a box that is already on screen
   * and looks ready. An uncontrolled input keeps what the visitor typed,
   * because React never claims ownership of its value.
   *
   * The URL is still the source of truth. `key` on the field below is what
   * enforces that: when the applied search changes — a new search, the back
   * button, the clear control — the input is replaced with a fresh one
   * carrying the new value, rather than kept and corrected.

   * was actually rendered.
   *
   * ── Why the selection is canonicalised, not used as-is ────────────────
   * The server matches case-insensitively, so `/cars?make=toyota` correctly
   * returns Toyotas. But a `<select value="toyota">` whose only option is
   * "Toyota" matches nothing, and React falls back to the first option — so
   * the grid would show Toyotas above a dropdown reading "Any make", and the
   * customer's next click would silently widen a search they thought was
   * narrow. Resolving the URL value back to the inventory's own spelling
   * keeps the control and the results telling the same story.
   *
   * A value that matches no option at all (a stale link to a make that has
   * since sold out) resolves to "Any", which is honest: the grid below is
   * empty and the bar shows nothing selected to explain it.

 *
 * ── Why a native `<details>` ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three stacked selects and their labels are roughly 230px of a 844px
 * phone screen, sitting directly between the search box and the first
 * vehicle. Collapsing them by default is the single biggest thing that can
 * be done for the mobile catalogue.
 *
 * `<details>` does that with no JavaScript at all: the disclosure works,
 * it is keyboard operable, and assistive technology already knows what it
 * is. The element is rendered *open* by the server, so a visitor whose
 * JavaScript never arrives gets the filters expanded and usable rather
 * than hidden behind a control that cannot respond — the failure mode of
 * every state-driven version of this.
 *
 * The effect below is therefore an enhancement in the true sense: it
 * closes the panel on a phone once it knows the page is live, and forces
 * it back open if the viewport ever crosses into the range where the
 * summary is hidden.
 *
 * ── No result count in here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The catalogue renders it once above the grid, with its own `aria-live`.
 * Stating it in the bar as well put the same sentence on screen twice, and
 * a second live region would have announced it twice to a screen reader.

 * The catalogue is one long grid. Once the bar at the top has scrolled
 * away, changing the search means scrolling back up, and on a phone that is
 * far enough to feel like leaving. This keeps one small control within
 * reach: pressing it opens the search field where the customer already is.
 *
 * ── Why it is a pure enhancement ──────────────────────────────────────
 * It only exists once the bar above has genuinely scrolled out of view,
 * which is a state only the browser can report — so nothing here is
 * rendered on the server and nothing about it is required for the search
 * to work. The panel it opens is a real GET form carrying the current
 * dropdown selections as hidden fields, so a submission from it narrows
 * the same search rather than replacing it.
 *
 * ── Why not a modal ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A dialog would trap focus and cover the results the customer is reading.
 * This is a disclosure: it announces its state through `aria-expanded`,
 * closes on Escape or an outside press, and returns focus to the button it
 * came from. Nothing underneath it is made inert, because nothing
 * underneath it needs to be.
