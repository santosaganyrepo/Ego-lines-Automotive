/**
 * "New" or "Used", as the first thing read about a vehicle.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the shared Badge ──────────────────────────────────
 * Badge is a full pill in one of six neutral-to-gold variants, and it is
 * used across this site for statuses that are *incidental* to the thing
 * they sit on ("Available", "Japan"). Condition is not incidental — it is
 * the fact that changes what every other number on the page means, and the
 * brief asks for it as a tag anchored to the top of the summary block with
 * its own two-colour treatment. Squeezing that into Badge would mean adding
 * a variant that exists for exactly one caller and inherits a pill shape
 * chosen for a different job.
 *
 * ── The two colours ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * New takes the brand gold; used takes red. Both are rendered as a tint
 * with a matching border and ink rather than as a solid fill — the solid
 * gold fill is reserved for the single primary CTA on a surface, and a
 * solid red block on a premium listing reads as an error state rather than
 * as a fact about a car.
 *
 * Colour is never the only signal: the label is always spelled out, so the
 * distinction survives greyscale, colour-blindness and a screen reader.
