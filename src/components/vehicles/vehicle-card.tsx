/**
 * One vehicle in the public catalogue.
 *
 * ── The three bands, and why they are three ───────────────────────────
 * A card is a photograph, an identity, and a set of facts — in that order,
 * separated so the eye can take them one at a time instead of reading a
 * paragraph of mixed weights.
 *
 *     ┌──────────────────────────────┐
 *     │  photograph (16:10)   [JAPAN]│  ~60% of the card's height
 *     ├──────────────────────────────┤
 *     │  Toyota Harrier 2021  $22,500│  Manrope, black · price in green
 *     │  ─────────────────────────── │  hairline
 *     │  ⚙ Automatic  ⛽ Petrol       │  Inter, muted grey
 *     │  ⬡ 2.0L       ⏱ 42,000 km  ▸ │  2×2 matrix · Explore on the right
 *     └──────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * The photograph is the largest single element by a wide margin, which is
 * the brief's "photography first" rule expressed as a proportion rather
 * than as an intention. Everything below it is sized so the picture keeps
 * roughly 60% of the card at every grid width.
 *
 * ── Why 16:10 and not 16:9 ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A slightly taller crop gives the photograph the height it needs to hold
 * that 60% share without the detail block having to be squeezed, and it is
 * still wide enough that a landscape vehicle photograph is cropped at the
 * top and bottom — where there is sky and tarmac — rather than at the
 * sides, where there is car. A 4:3 crop would sit deeper into the stated
 * band but starts eating the front and rear of the vehicle on a wide
 * source image, which is the one thing a vehicle photograph cannot lose.
 *
 * ── The identity band ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Make, model and year in Manrope at full foreground black, with the price
 * on the far right. This is the line someone reads to decide whether the
 * photograph is worth their attention, so nothing in it is greyed:
 * secondary colour on a primary line is how a card starts looking like a
 * database row.
 *
 * The price is the one coloured value on the card. Green because it is
 * money and because green is the only hue in this palette that is not
 * already spoken for — gold means Crownline, and a gold price would put
 * the brand accent on twelve cards at once. It is a deep, low-chroma green
 * (`--price`), chosen to read as considered rather than as a discount tag.
 *
 * ── The specification band ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Transmission, fuel, engine and mileage in a 2×2 matrix — the four facts
 * a buyer sorts on at a glance. In Inter, one step down, in muted grey,
 * each behind a small line icon: the whole band is deliberately quieter
 * than the line above it, because it is reference material rather than the
 * pitch. Everything else — drive type, colours, location, the full
 * gallery — is one tap away on the vehicle page, and the brief is explicit
 * that a card carrying fifteen specifications is a spreadsheet row with a
 * picture on it.
 *
 * The values are printed without visible labels, which is how the brief's
 * own card sketch reads — "42,000 km" and "Automatic" need no caption. The
 * terms stay in the `<dl>` as `sr-only` `<dt>`s, so a screen reader still
 * announces "Mileage, 42,000 km" rather than four loose fragments, and the
 * icons are `aria-hidden` so they are never read as a fifth thing.
 *
 * Country of origin sits on the photograph rather than in that matrix. For
 * this business it is a differentiator rather than a detail — Japan, South
 * Korea and China are the sources the company is built around.
 *
 * Availability is not shown. Every vehicle reachable from this grid is
 * PUBLISHED, because `publicVehicleWhere` admits nothing else, so an
 * "Available" chip on all twelve cards would be a label that never varies.
 * A badge that is always the same value is noise, not information.
 *
 * ── Why the whole card is one link ────────────────────────────────────
 * Pressing anywhere on the card opens the vehicle. One target is far
 * easier to hit on a phone, which is where most of this audience is, and
 * it leaves the card with a single tab stop instead of competing ones.
 *
 * "Explore" is therefore drawn as a button but is not one: a real
 * `<button>` or second `<a>` inside this link would be invalid markup and
 * would fight the card for the tap. It is an `aria-hidden` span that
 * inherits the card's hover, so it reads as the affordance it looks like
 * while the link stays the only control. Its 8px radius against the card's
 * rounder corners is the geometric contrast the brief asks for between
 * something pressable and something merely informative.

              Inter, not the Manrope the base layer gives an `<h3>`. Two
              reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one:

              Manrope's display proportions are drawn for headlines, and at
              card size a two-word vehicle name in it reads as a title
              rather than as a label on a product. Inter is the grotesque
              this design system already uses for everything factual, and
              the name of a car on a listing is a fact.

              More to the point, this line ends in a price. Manrope draws a
              dollar sign as a display glyph — a narrow stroked S that
              stops reading as currency once it sits beside four figures.
              Inter's is the conventional one, which is what a price on a
              car needs to be.

              Full foreground black: this is the line someone reads to
              decide whether the photograph is worth their attention, so
              nothing in it is greyed. The year keeps its own quieter
              treatment — a size down, lighter, slightly recessed — because
              it qualifies the name rather than competing with it.

              `min-w-0` lets a long model name truncate rather than shoving
              the price off the edge; the price is `shrink-0` because it is
              the one thing on this line that must never be clipped. */}

              block's own top border rather than a separate element —

              Content-sized columns, not `grid-cols-2`.

              Two equal halves spend the same width on "2.0L" as on
              "Automatic", and in a three-column row that waste is exactly
              enough to truncate the longest transmission label while half
              the engine column sits empty. `auto` columns give each one
              the width its own longest value needs and hand the slack to
              the Explore cue instead, while still aligning row two under
              row one, which is what makes this read as a matrix rather
              than as four loose labels.

              `min-w-0` on the items keeps `truncate` as the fallback for a
              value longer than anything in the current inventory, rather
              than letting one overflow the card.

              Two container steps below that. Note the thresholds are in
              *content-box* terms — a container query measures the
              container's content box, so a 332px card with 20px of padding
              each side queries as 292px, not 332px.

              At 322px of content the generous gaps close up, buying back
              the ~36px that "Automatic" beside "250,000 km" needs.
              Narrow rules on purpose: spending that everywhere to satisfy
              the tightest column would cost every other visitor the
              breathing room this band was widened for.

              At 288px no arrangement of gaps fits both, so the cue drops
              below the matrix and takes the full width. That happens where
              a grid or a strip has already given every card the same
              narrow column, so they all do it at once and the row stays
              uniform — a phone-width card in the "You may also like"
              strip is the common case, and a full-width gold button is a
              better thing to hand a thumb anyway.

              Both numbers were set by measurement, not arithmetic: every
              card is rendered with the longest value each specification
              can hold ("Automatic", "Electric", "250,000 km") and swept
              across seventeen viewport widths on both surfaces. Change one
              and re-run that sweep — the bands are only a few pixels wider
              than the text they have to hold.
