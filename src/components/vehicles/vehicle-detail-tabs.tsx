/**
 * Specifications and features, one at a time.
 *
 * ── Why these two share a surface ─────────────────────────────────────
 * They answer the same question — "what is this car" — from two sides:
 * the measured facts, and the equipment. Stacked, they make a wall of
 * fifty short lines that a buyer scrolls past rather than reads. Side by
 * side, neither gets the width its layout wants. A toggle gives both the
 * full measure and lets the buyer pick which question they are asking.
 *
 * ── This one *is* an ARIA tablist, unlike the gallery ─────────────────
 * VehicleGallery deliberately marks its thumbnails as plain buttons,
 * because it has one panel whose contents change. Here there are genuinely
 * two labelled panels, so the tab pattern is the honest description — and
 * committing to it means implementing all of it: roving focus, arrow keys,
 * Home/End, and `tabIndex={-1}` on the inactive tab so the tablist is one
 * tab stop rather than two.
 *
 * ── Why the inactive panel is unmounted, not hidden ───────────────────
 * `hidden` would keep both in the DOM, which is right for a gallery
 * preloading images and wrong here: the hidden panel's headings would stay
 * in the accessibility tree's document outline, and a specification and a
 * feature list are read out of order by a screen reader navigating by
 * heading. Neither panel holds state worth preserving across a toggle.
