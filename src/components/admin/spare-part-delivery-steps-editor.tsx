/**
 * The "How your part reaches you" steps, as edited in Settings.
 *
 * These are the four or five sentences shown on every spare-part page
 * explaining what happens between an enquiry and a box in Juba. They are
 * configuration rather than code because the business will change how it
 * words this long before it changes how it works, and a copy change should
 * not be a deploy.
 *
 * ── Why the rows are submitted as one JSON string ─────────────────────
 * A list of pairs cannot survive `FormData` as repeated fields. Removing the
 * middle row leaves two flat lists — titles and descriptions — that have to
 * be re-paired by position, and any mismatch silently attaches one step's
 * sentence to another step's heading. One hidden field holding the whole
 * array keeps each row intact through the request.
 *
 * The server does not trust that string: `businessSettingsSchema` parses it
 * and validates every row (see the note there). This component's own limits
 * — the maximum number of steps, the field lengths — are conveniences that
 * stop an operator writing something the server will reject, not the rule
 * itself.
 *
 * ── Ordering ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Array order *is* step order, and the arrows move a row within it. Drag and
 * drop was considered and refused: it needs a pointer, so it fails the
 * operator on a tablet, and a reorder that only works with a mouse is a
 * feature that is missing exactly when someone is standing in the warehouse.
 * The grip glyph is decorative — the arrows are the control.

  /**
   * What is stored, or null when the operator has never configured this.
   *
   * The two are genuinely different and the editor says so: null opens
   * showing the built-in steps with a note that they are the fallback, so
   * saving adopts them rather than leaving the page silently dependent on a
   * constant in the codebase.

/**
 * A row, with a key that survives its neighbours being removed.
 *
 * Keying by array index breaks the moment a row is removed from the middle:
 * React reuses the DOM node, and the focus and selection inside it stay with
 * the *position* rather than with the step. So each row carries a key that
 * lives exactly as long as it does.
 *
 * ── The key is never rendered, and that is the point ──────────────────
 * An earlier version of this used a module-level counter and put the key into
 * `htmlFor`/`id`. That is a hydration bug: the module is evaluated once on
 * the server, which numbers the initial rows 1–4, and again in the browser,
 * which numbers them 5–8. React cannot patch mismatched attributes, so every
 * label was left pointing at an element id that did not exist — the control
 * association silently gone, on a form, for exactly the users who depend on
 * it most.
 *
 * The two concerns are therefore kept apart:
 *
 *   `key`   — reconciliation only. Never reaches the DOM, so it is free to be
 *             allocated from a counter.
 *   the ids — derived from `useId()` and the row's current index, both of
 *             which are identical on the server and in the browser.
