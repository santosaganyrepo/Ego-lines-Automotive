 * A separate photos screen where every image carried a category select, a
 * description field, two reorder buttons and a delete button — and where
 * which image was the cover was decided by a rule rather than shown as a
 * choice. Categories are gone entirely (they described the photograph to
 * nobody), and the arrangement is now the one distinction that changes what
 * a customer sees: one main image, then the rest.
 *
 * Every control is still a real `<form>` posting to a Server Action, not an
 * `onClick` calling one — so the request carries the same CSRF-checked path
 * and the same server-side authorisation as everything else in the
 * dashboard. The menus submit those forms; they do not replace them.
 *
 * Feedback is shared across the whole gallery rather than per tile. These
 * actions are mutually exclusive in practice, and a message per tile would
 * put a dozen live regions on one screen.
