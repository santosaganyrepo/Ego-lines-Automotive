   * React resets a `<form action={fn}>` to its defaults once the action
   * settles, on failure as much as on success — so a mistyped password used
   * to clear the email too, and every retry started from an empty form.
   * Assigning a changed `defaultValue` to the mounted input would fix the
   * value but move a default underneath a live control, which Base UI's
   * FieldControl rightly objects to; a fresh instance per attempt has no
   * such contradiction.

   * The password field is untouched. It is not echoed by the action and
