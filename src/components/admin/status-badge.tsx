 * A small state label — vehicle status, payment status, shipment stage.
 *
 * Tone is separate from the brand accent on purpose. Gold means "Crownline"
 * throughout this application; if it also meant "published", an operator
 * scanning a list would have to work out which sense applied each time. The
 * palette here is semantic and used nowhere else.
 *
 * Every tone pairs a background with a border and a dot, so the badges
 * remain distinguishable from one another in a monochrome print or to a
 * viewer who cannot separate the hues — the label itself always carries the
 * actual meaning.
