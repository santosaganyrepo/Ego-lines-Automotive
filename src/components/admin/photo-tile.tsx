/**
 * One photograph in the dashboard's gallery, with its own controls.
 *
 * ── Why every image gets the same tile ────────────────────────────────
 * The main image and the supporting ones differ in exactly two ways: the
 * main one is larger, and it has nothing to be promoted to. Everything else
 * — the preview, the menu, removal — is identical, and building them as two
 * components is how a dashboard ends up where only the cover image can be
 * removed.
 *
 * The controls sit behind a single overflow menu rather than a row of
 * buttons. A gallery is a grid of photographs; a grid of photographs with
 * three buttons under each one is a control panel with pictures in it. The
 * menu keeps the images the thing you look at, and keeps a destructive
 * action from sitting one mis-tap away from a thumbnail on a phone.
