 * Next.js Proxy (called Middleware before Next.js 16).

 * convenience rather than the thing protecting the admin area.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file must live at `src/proxy.ts`, not the repository root.
 * Next.js looks for it "in the project root, or inside `src` if applicable,
 * so that it is located at the same level as `pages` or `app`". This project
 * keeps `app` under `src/`, so a root-level proxy.ts is silently ignored —
 * it still type-checks, still gets bundled, and never runs. Do not move it.
