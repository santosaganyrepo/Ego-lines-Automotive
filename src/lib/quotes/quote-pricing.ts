 * would be one more column every edit path had to remember to update, and
 * the first one that forgot would send a customer a PDF whose total does not
 * add up. The figure is frozen exactly once: into Order.totalAmount, when the
 * quote is converted.
 *
 * Pure, and used by the operator's editor (live, as they type), the server
 * action that validates a save, the PDF, the dispatch message and the
 * conversion — so all five agree to the cent by construction.
