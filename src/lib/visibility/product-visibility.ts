/**
 * Which facts about a listing a customer may see.
 *
 * Two switches decide it, and both have to be on:
 *
 *   1. Settings → Catalogue display — one switch per fact, for the whole
 *      catalogue ("never show mileage on this site").
 *   2. The listing's own `hiddenFields` — facts an operator has withheld on
 *      one vehicle or part, usually because they are not yet sure of them.
 *
 * A hidden fact is hidden everywhere a customer can reach it: cards, the
 * listing page, the quick view, page metadata, structured data, WhatsApp
 * messages, and the filters and search that could otherwise reveal it by
 * narrowing results. That is enforced where the public DTOs are built (see
 * public-vehicle.queries.ts and public-spare-part.queries.ts) — a hidden
 * value is replaced there and never reaches a component, so no page can
 * render it by forgetting a check.
 *
 * This module has no server-only imports: the admin forms render the same
 * field list and copy.
 *
 * Identity is not switchable. A vehicle is always its make and model, and a
 * part is always its name — a listing without them is not a listing.
