/**
 * Reads for the public spare-parts catalogue.
 *
 * ── Why this is a separate module from spare-part.queries.ts ──────────
 * That module serves the admin dashboard, and its list query deliberately
 * applies *no* status filter by default — an operator looking for a part they
 * archived last month has to be able to find it. That is correct there and
 * catastrophic here. It also selects `supplierName` and `supplierNotes`,
 * which are internal sourcing records: what a part cost us, who to ask for,
 * and how long they take. Publishing those would hand every customer the
 * dealership's margin.
 *
 * Keeping the two in separate modules is not tidiness. It means the public
 * side never inherits a default written for the dashboard, and a filter added
 * for an operator cannot silently widen what a customer sees. Every read
 * below goes through `publicSparePartWhere`, which pins the status and cannot
 * be talked out of it.
 *
 * ── What the DTOs deliberately omit ───────────────────────────────────
 * At the dealership's instruction the catalogue does not show a part's
 * condition, its country of origin, whether it is priced or quoted, how many
 * are in stock, or anything about where it was sourced. Those columns all
 * still exist and the dashboard still shows them — they are operational
 * facts, not listing copy.
 *
 * The way that instruction is honoured here is by *not selecting the
 * columns*, rather than by leaving them out of a component. A DTO that
 * carried `stockQuantity` would be one careless `{part.stockQuantity}` away
 * from publishing it, and nothing would fail. A DTO that never held it cannot
 * leak it, and adding it back is a deliberate edit in this file.
 *
 * `pricingMode` is the one that needs saying out loud: it is not in any DTO,
 * and a quoted part is represented by `price: null`. The customer sees "Price
 * on enquiry" — which is a fact about *this listing*, not the name of an
 * internal pricing strategy. There is nothing for a component to branch on
 * beyond the price it was given.
 *
 * ── Facts an operator has hidden ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Settings → Catalogue display hides a fact for every part, and a part's own
 * `hiddenFields` hides it for that one (see
 * `@/lib/visibility/product-visibility`). Both are applied while the DTO is
 * built, so a hidden value is null in the payload and nothing downstream can
 * publish it. Search and the category filter honour the same rule, because
 * narrowing results by a fact reveals it as surely as printing it. A hidden
 * price is represented exactly like a quoted one: `price: null`.
 *
 * Decimals are converted to numbers here, as in every other query module:
 * Prisma's Decimal is not serialisable across the server/client boundary, and
 * Decimal(12,2) tops out well below 2^53.
