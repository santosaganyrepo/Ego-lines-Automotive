/**
 * Reads for the public vehicle marketplace.
 *
 * ── Why this is a separate module from vehicle.queries.ts ─────────────
 * `vehicle.queries.ts` serves the admin dashboard, and its list query
 * deliberately applies *no* status filter by default — an operator looking
 * for a vehicle they archived last month has to be able to find it. That is
 * correct there and catastrophic here: the same query behind /cars would put
 * unfinished drafts, vehicles already sold, and withdrawn listings in front
 * of customers, complete with prices nobody intended to publish.
 *
 * Keeping the two in separate modules is not tidiness. It means the public
 * side never inherits a default from a query written for the dashboard, and
 * that a future filter added for an operator cannot silently widen what a
 * customer sees. Every read below goes through `publicVehicleWhere`, which
 * pins the status and cannot be talked out of it.
 *
 * ── What the DTOs deliberately omit ───────────────────────────────────
 * No `status`, no internal timestamps, no id where a slug will do. A
 * customer-facing payload should not carry fields whose only use is
 * administrative — partly because they are nobody's business, and partly
 * because a component that cannot read a status cannot accidentally render
 * one.
 *
 * ── Facts an operator has hidden ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Settings → Catalogue display hides a fact for every listing, and a
 * listing's own `hiddenFields` hides it for that one (see
 * `@/lib/visibility/product-visibility`). Both are applied *here*, while the
 * DTO is built: a hidden value is null in the payload, so no component, page
 * or metadata builder downstream can publish it by forgetting a check. The
 * search and the filter options honour the same rule, because narrowing a
 * result set by a fact reveals it just as surely as printing it.
 *
 * Decimals are converted to numbers here for the same reason they are in the
 * admin module: Prisma's Decimal is not serialisable across the
 * server/client boundary. Decimal(12,2) tops out well below 2^53.

/**
 * Turns the parsed search criteria into a `where` fragment (Stage 12).
 *
 * ── The dropdowns: case-insensitive equality, not `contains` ──────────
 * The filter bar is a set of dropdowns whose options are the makes, models
 * and years that actually exist in the published inventory, so the value is
 * a whole make or a whole model — never a fragment. `contains` would make
 * "Prado" also match a hypothetical "Land Cruiser Prado SX", which reads as
 * a feature until it silently matches something the customer did not pick.
 *
 * Insensitive because the URL is hand-editable and shared: `?make=toyota`
 * typed into a phone must find the same cars as the dropdown's "Toyota".
 *
 * ── The search box: every word must match something ───────────────────
 * `q` is one field standing in for three, so each word is matched against
 * make, model *or* year (an OR), and the words are then ANDed together.
 * That is what makes "harrier 2021" mean "a Harrier, from 2021" rather than
 * "anything Harrier-ish or anything from 2021" — the second reading returns
 * the whole 2021 floor and reads as a search that ignored half the query.
 *
 * Here `contains` is right where `equals` was right above: a customer
 * typing into a box is working from memory and half a name ("cruis") is a
 * legitimate query, whereas a dropdown hands back a whole value.
 *
 * Case is handled by `mode: "insensitive"` rather than by lower-casing the
 * input, so "HARRIER", "Harrier" and "harrier" are one search.
 *
 * ── A note for when the inventory grows ───────────────────────────────
 * `mode: "insensitive"` compiles to `ILIKE`, which neither the
 * `[make, model]` B-tree nor a plain index can serve — and with `contains`
 * the pattern is leading-wildcard, so no B-tree ever could. Both are
 * sequential scans. On a single dealership's inventory — hundreds of rows,
 * not millions — that is microseconds, and the page reads only one bounded
 * page of results at a time. If this ever holds tens of thousands of
 * vehicles, the fix is a `pg_trgm` GIN index on `make` and `model` (which
 * *does* serve a leading-wildcard `ILIKE`), not a change to this logic.
 *
 * Filters are ANDed with each other and with the search box: typing
 * "harrier" and then choosing 2021 returns the vehicles matching both,
 * which is the "Toyota → Harrier → 2021" journey from the brief.

/**
 * The options the catalogue's filter bar offers (Stage 12).
 *
 * ── Why the options come from the inventory, not from a list ──────────
 * A dropdown of every make Toyota has ever built would let a customer
 * construct a search that cannot possibly match anything, and the honest
 * answer — "no results" — would read as a broken site rather than as an
 * empty shelf. Offering only what is actually published means every
 * selection leads somewhere, which is also what makes the three filters
 * usable in combination: choosing Toyota narrows the model list to the
 * Toyotas on the floor, and choosing Harrier narrows the years to the ones
 * a Harrier is listed for.
 *
 * The visibility rule is the same one every other public read uses. A make
 * that exists only on a draft or a sold vehicle must not appear here — it
 * would advertise stock that cannot be seen, and it would leak the shape of
 * unpublished inventory.

 *
 * ── Why one flat query rather than three grouped ones ─────────────────
 * The filter bar needs the *relationships* between the three fields, not
 * three independent lists: which models belong to a make, which years belong
 * to a model. Three `groupBy` queries would return the lists but not the
 * links, so choosing "Toyota" could still offer "Sorento". One distinct
 * triple carries the whole tree, and the client narrows it without another
 * round trip — which matters on the mobile connections this audience uses.
 *
 * The payload is bounded by distinct combinations, not by inventory size: a
 * dealership holding two hundred vehicles has perhaps sixty distinct
 * triples, a few kilobytes. If that ever stops being true, the answer is to
 * fetch models and years on demand per selection, not to denormalise this.
