/**
 * The "how this reaches you" steps shown on every spare-part page.
 *
 * ── What this file is, and what the database is ───────────────────────
 * This is the *fallback*, not the source of truth. The operator edits the
 * real steps in Settings, and they are stored on `BusinessSettings`
 * (`sparePartDeliverySteps`). What lives here is what a page shows before
 * anybody has opened that screen — on a fresh install, or on an environment
 * restored from a backup taken before the field existed.
 *
 * A fallback matters more than it looks. The alternative is a part page that
 * renders nothing where the reassurance should be, on the section of the site
 * whose entire job is to convince someone in Juba that money sent abroad
 * comes back as a part. An empty space says less than an honest default.
 *
 * ── Why these four ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * They are the parts pipeline as the business actually runs it, and they are
 * deliberately *not* the vehicle timeline. A car goes through inspection,
 * export documentation, a ship to Mombasa and a customs clearance, and every
 * one of those steps is real and none of them describes a box of brake pads.
 * Forcing parts through the vehicle narrative is exactly what the brief warns
 * against, and a customer who reads "arrives at Mombasa" under a set of
 * filters learns that the page was written for something else.
 *
 * Four steps, because a list a customer will not read is not reassurance. The
 * detail of any one of them is a WhatsApp message away, which every page
 * already offers.
