/**
 * Writer for the AuditLog table (SECURITY.MD §39, brief §10 "Payments").
 *
 * AuditLog covers administrative actions that do not already carry a
 * dedicated "who did this" column. It is not redundant with
 * Payment.verifiedByAdminId or TrackingEvent.createdByAdminId — those are
 * structural fields on records that need the actor without a join. This
 * table covers everything else: price changes, publishes, cancellations,
 * sign-ins.
 *
 * ── Why actorId is always a real admin ────────────────────────────────
 * AuditLog.actorId is a required, Restrict foreign key to AdminProfile. A
 * failed sign-in by someone who is not an administrator therefore cannot be
 * written here at all, by design — there is no actor to attribute it to.
 * Those attempts are recorded by Supabase Auth's own logs and, in this
 * codebase, through `logSecurityEvent` below. Do not work around the
 * constraint by inventing placeholder actor rows; it would corrupt the one
 * table whose value depends entirely on being trustworthy.
