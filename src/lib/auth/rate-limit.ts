/**
 * Rate limiting for administrator sign-in (SECURITY.MD §5.5, brief §17).
 *
 * ── What this is defending against ────────────────────────────────────
 * Credential stuffing and password guessing against a dashboard that can
 * publish listings, change prices and confirm payments. Supabase applies its
 * own limits to `signInWithPassword`, which is real but not ours to tune,
 * not visible to the operator, and not expressible in the business's terms.
 * This layer is the one Crownline controls: seven attempts, fifteen minutes,
 * stated in a message the person reading it can act on.
 *
 * ── Why two keys, not one ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Limiting only by email lets one host walk a list of addresses at full
 * speed, never tripping any single account's budget. Limiting only by IP
 * lets a botnet spread the same attack across hosts and never trip that
 * one. Both counters therefore run on every attempt and either can refuse.
 *
 * The consequence worth knowing: staff behind a single office NAT share the
 * IP budget. With a handful of administrators that is the right trade — the
 * lockout is fifteen minutes, not permanent, and a shared address that has
 * produced seven failures in that time is worth pausing either way.
 *
 * ── Why failures only ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only failed attempts are recorded, and a success clears the counters for
 * both of that attempt's keys. An administrator who signs in correctly is
 * never a step closer to being locked out by their own work.
 *
 * ── Where this is going ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The roadmap puts Upstash Redis in Phase 2, and this is exactly the
 * workload it is for. This module is the only place that reads or writes
 * LoginAttempt, so that migration is a change to one file. See the model's
 * comment in prisma/schema.prisma for why Postgres, and not an in-memory
 * Map, is correct in the meantime.
