// Security notes:
// - The phone number is sanitized to digits-only before it ever reaches a
//   URL. It comes from an env var an admin controls, so this isn't a
//   defense against a hostile actor — it's a guard against a misconfigured
//   value (stray spaces, dashes, a leading "+") silently producing a
//   broken or malformed wa.me link.
// - The message text is never string-concatenated into the URL. It always
//   goes through URLSearchParams, which percent-encodes it — so a message
//   containing "&", "#", or other URL-meaningful characters can't break out
//   of the query string or inject extra parameters.

 * Every message that can carry a reference does. "I am interested in the

 * reference is what lets whoever answers reply about the car rather than
 * spend two messages working out which car. The same reasoning applies to
 * an order number and a tracking number, where it is the difference between
 * a support conversation that starts with an answer and one that starts
 * with "which order?".
 *
 * None of these interpolate into a URL themselves — `buildWhatsAppUrl`
 * percent-encodes the whole message through URLSearchParams, so a model
 * name containing "&" is text, never a second query parameter.
