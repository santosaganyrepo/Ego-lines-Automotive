/**
 * Runs before every matched request (see src/proxy.ts).
 *
 * It does two things, and it is important to be precise about which of them
 * is a security control:
 *
 *   1. **Refreshes the session.** Supabase access tokens are short-lived.
 *      Server Components cannot write cookies, so without a refresh here
 *      every rotated token would be computed and then thrown away, and
 *      administrators would be signed out roughly hourly mid-task. This part
 *      is essential.
 *
 *   2. **Redirects unauthenticated requests away from the dashboard.** This
 *      is *not* a security control. It is there so an expired session
 *      produces a sign-in page instead of a flash of dashboard chrome.
 *
 * Point 2 must never be relied upon. CVE-2025-29927 allowed Next.js
 * middleware to be skipped entirely with a forged `x-middleware-subrequest`
 * header, and Next's own guidance is that proxy checks are "optimistic" and
 * that real checks belong next to the data. Security-files/authentication.md
 * says the same in as many words. The actual enforcement is
 * `requireAdmin()` / `authorizeAdmin()` in src/lib/auth/, which every admin
 * page and action calls, and which verifies the JWT *and* re-reads
 * AdminProfile.isActive from our own database.
 *
 * Deliberately absent here: any database lookup. The proxy only asks
 * "is there a valid session?", never "is this person staff?". Answering the
 * second question here would add a query to every request while changing
 * nothing about what is actually enforced.

/**
 * Cache directive for anything whose response depends on who is asking.
 *
 * Set in the proxy rather than next.config.ts, which loses this particular
 * race: Next.js writes its own `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`
 * onto dynamic responses, overriding a configured header. The proxy runs
 * last, so this is the one place the directive survives.
 *
 * `no-store` and `private` are the parts that matter. Cloudflare sits in
 * front of this application in production, and an admin page or an auth
 * callback held in a shared cache would be served to whoever asks next
 * (SECURITY.MD §47).
