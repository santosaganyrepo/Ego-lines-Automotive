/**
 * The public vehicle marketplace, as a customer meets it.
 *
 * ── What this covers, and what it deliberately does not ───────────────
 * The path from the catalogue to a vehicle page and back: that listings
 * render from the database rather than from anything hard-coded, that a
 * card carries what the brief asks a card to carry, that opening one shows
 * the full listing, and that a URL which is not a live listing answers with
 * a genuine 404 rather than a soft one.
 *
 * It runs signed out, against whatever the connected database happens to
 * hold. That is deliberate — it is the same view an anonymous visitor gets
 * — but it means the suite must not assume a particular vehicle exists.
 * Where a test needs a card, it takes the first one on the page and asserts
 * about its structure, never about a specific make or price.
 *
 * Creating a vehicle and publishing it is the admin suite's job
 * (`tests/e2e/admin/vehicles.spec.ts`); repeating it here would need a
 * signed-in session for a page that is supposed to work without one.
 */

/**
 * Opens a catalogue card and waits for the vehicle page to actually arrive.
 *
 * ── Why this is `waitForURL` and not `expect(page).toHaveURL(...)` ────
 * The distinction is the whole reason this helper exists. An `expect` is
 * bounded by `expect.timeout` — 15s here — while `page.waitForURL` is bounded
 * by `navigationTimeout`, which this project deliberately sets to 45s.
 *
 * The webServer runs `next dev`, which compiles a route on its first request;
 * `playwright.config.ts` records that being measured at 17s on this
 * filesystem. So the first test in a worker to open `/cars/[slug]` can spend
 * longer inside the navigation than an assertion is allowed to wait, and any
 * assertion written straight after the click inherits that wait: Playwright
 * blocks a locator query while a navigation is in flight. The failure then
 * reads as "element(s) not found" against a page that was never served —
 * which is exactly how it presented, intermittently and only in whichever
 * project happened to hit the cold route.
 *
 * Waiting for the navigation explicitly separates the two budgets: the cold
 * compile gets the 45s it was given, and the assertion after it gets a full
 * 15s to find something on a page that has definitely arrived.
 *
 * ── And why it stops at `domcontentloaded` ────────────────────────────
 * `waitForURL` defaults to waiting for `load`, which on a vehicle page means
 * every photograph in the gallery — a wait on the images rather than on the
 * navigation, and one that has exceeded even the 45s budget on WebKit. The
 * markup is what the assertions need, and that is complete at
 * `domcontentloaded`; anything still streaming after it is auto-waited by the
 * locators themselves.
 */

  /**
   * Retried, because a swallowed click leaves no trace to assert on.
   *
   * `waitForInteractive` closes the window in practice, but it is a heuristic
   * about someone else's dev server and not a guarantee. If a click is
   * dropped, nothing throws — the page simply stays where it was — so without
   * a retry the failure surfaces 45s later as a navigation that never
   * started, which is the least informative shape it could take.
   *
   * The URL is checked first so a retry never fires a second click at a page
   * the first one already left; on the destination the card does not exist and
   * the retry would fail on the click rather than notice it had succeeded.

/**
 * Waits for the page to be interactive before dispatching a click at it.
 *
 * ── What this guards, and why it is not an application bug ────────────
 * A click dispatched after `domcontentloaded` but before the App Router has
 * attached is swallowed: the anchor's default is prevented by React's
 * delegated handler, and the router is not yet listening to do anything with
 * it. Nothing navigates, no error is raised, and the assertion that follows
 * describes a page the test never left.
 *
 * Measured on the vehicle catalogue, first card, eight runs each:
 *
 *     next dev     · click immediately        7/8 failed
 *     next dev     · click after `load`       6/8 failed
 *     next dev     · click after networkidle  0/8 failed
 *     next start   · click immediately        0/8 failed
 *
 * The last row is the one that matters: against a production build the race
 * does not exist, because the bundle is a fraction of the size and hydration
 * lands with the document. This is the dev webServer's unminified bundle plus
 * its HMR runtime, and it is a property of the harness rather than of what
 * ships. It also failed identically on a non-touch viewport, which rules out
 * tap handling.
 *
 * `networkidle` distinguishes the two states where `load` demonstrably does
 * not, and on this page it resolves in about 2.5s.
 *
 * It is only a proxy, though — it means "no request for 500ms", which a gap
 * between two dev-server compiles also satisfies. So it is a fast path, not a
 * guarantee, and the callers pair it with a retry that does not depend on
 * guessing when hydration landed.
