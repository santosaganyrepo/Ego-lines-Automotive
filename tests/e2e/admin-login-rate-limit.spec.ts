/**
 * The administrator sign-in throttle, end to end.
 *
 * The limiter's own logic is covered exhaustively by
 * tests/unit/login-rate-limit.test.ts. What only a browser can prove is that
 * it is actually *wired*: that `signInAction` consults it before checking a
 * password, and that the refusal reaches the form as something a person can
 * read rather than as a generic failure.
 *
 * ── Why this cannot lock the rest of the suite out ────────────────────
 * The limiter counts by email and by client IP, and this test deliberately
 * spends the IP budget. That would be a problem if the authenticated
 * projects signed in the same way — but they do not:
 * `tests/e2e/setup/admin-session.setup.ts` mints a Supabase recovery link
 * and exchanges it at /auth/confirm, never touching `signInAction`. Nothing
 * else in the suite posts the sign-in form.
 *
 * The email used is a random address that belongs to no account, so no real
 * administrator is locked out either.
 *
 * ── Why one project, serial ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four browser projects each firing eight attempts would race on the shared
 * IP counter and the assertions would depend on which finished first. This
 * runs once, in order.
 *
 * ── Why it clears the counters around itself ──────────────────────────
 * The email is fresh every run, but the IP counter is not: a previous run
 * leaves attempts in the window, so the second run of the day would trip
 * the limit early and fail against its own history rather than against the
 * code. Clearing before and after makes the test deterministic and leaves
 * nothing behind.
 *
 * The delete is scoped to the "admin-login:" prefix and touches no other
 * table. LoginAttempt is ephemeral throttling state that the limiter prunes
 * on its own, so emptying it costs nothing beyond a brief window in which
 * the limit is unspent — which is exactly the state it is in most of the
 * time anyway.
 *
 * It talks to Postgres through `pg` rather than through Prisma. The
 * application's client is marked `server-only` and cannot be loaded here,
 * and the generated client is an ESM module that Playwright's transform
 * refuses. One parameterised DELETE needs neither — the same spirit as the
 * raw Supabase admin call in setup/admin-session.setup.ts.
