 * The catalogue's search and filtering (Stage 12), as a customer meets it.
 *
 * ── Written against whatever the database holds ───────────────────────
 * Like the browsing suite, this runs signed out against the connected
 * inventory, so it must not assume a particular make exists. Where a test
 * needs a value it reads one out of the Make dropdown — whose options are
 * themselves drawn from the published inventory — and asserts about
 * behaviour rather than about "Toyota". A suite that hard-codes a make goes
 * red the day that car sells.
 *
 * ── What is worth proving here rather than in a unit test ─────────────
 * The parsing, the where clause and the URL building are covered
 * exhaustively by tests/unit/vehicle-filters.test.ts. What only a browser
 * can show is that the whole loop closes: a selection becomes a URL, the URL
 * becomes a filtered server render, and the controls come back reflecting
 * what was asked for. Plus the two failure modes that are invisible in unit
 * tests — a junk query string taking the page down, and a filter that
 * survives being shared as a link.

 * itself, and a skipped test reports as a kind of success. The summary is
 * hidden from `sm` up, so on desktop this is a no-op.

   *     panel a moment *after* an early click had opened it, so the select
   *     was gone again by the time the test reached for it.
   *
   * Waiting for the network to settle covers the common case; the retry

/**
 * The page's main region — and every catalogue locator in this file is scoped

 * The catalogue streams: `loading.tsx` opens a Suspense boundary, so React
 * delivers the results into a hidden `<div id="S:n">` parked at the end of
 * `<body>` and then moves the nodes into the boundary inside `<main>`. For the
 * few milliseconds between those two steps the document genuinely contains two
 * copies of the grid — one visible, one `display:none` and outside `main`.
 *
 * Playwright's auto-retry does not save an unscoped locator here, because a
 * strict-mode violation *throws* rather than retrying: land one poll inside
 * that window and the assertion fails outright with "resolved to 2 elements",
 * on a page that is completely correct a frame later. It reproduced on roughly
 * one run in three, which is worse than a consistent failure.
 *
 * Scoping to `main` is not a workaround for that race so much as the more
 * honest assertion: what is being tested is what the customer can see, and the
 * streaming buffer is neither visible nor in the main region.

/**

 * ── Why a helper rather than a bare `page.goto` ───────────────────────
 * `page.goto` resolves on `load`, which on this page is *before* the Suspense
 * boundary that `loading.tsx` opens has resolved. Anything read immediately
 * afterwards with a non-retrying call — `count()`, `allTextContents()`,
 * `isVisible()` — is answering for a half-built page.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical: it was silently skipping between two and nine of
 * the fifteen tests in this file on any given run, each with a message
 * claiming the inventory lacked the data. A test that skips itself for the
 * wrong reason is worse than one that fails, because the suite still reports
 * green.
 *
 * Waiting for the filter panel or the empty state — the two things the
