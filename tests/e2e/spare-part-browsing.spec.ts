/**
 * The public spare-parts catalogue, as a customer meets it.
 *
 * ── What this covers, and what it deliberately does not ───────────────
 * The path a parts customer actually takes: browse by category, search by
 * number, preview a part without losing your place in the grid, add it to the
 * list, and open the full page. Plus the two things that must never happen —
 * an internal figure appearing on a public page, and an unpublished slug
 * answering with a soft 404.
 *
 * It runs signed out, against whatever the connected database happens to
 * hold. That is deliberate — it is the view an anonymous visitor gets — but
 * it means the suite must not assume a particular part exists. Where a test
 * needs a card it takes the first one on the page and asserts about its
 * structure, never about a specific part or price.
 *
 * Creating a part and publishing it is the admin suite's job
 * (`tests/e2e/admin/spare-parts.spec.ts`); repeating it here would need a
 * signed-in session for a page that is supposed to work without one.
 */

/**
 * The catalogue shows a grid of cards or a stated empty state — never neither.
 *
 * ── Everything here is scoped to `<main>`, and it has to be ───────────
 * The catalogue sits under a Suspense boundary (its `loading.tsx`), so React
 * streams it: the boundary's HTML is delivered inside a `<div id="S:0" hidden>`
 * parked at the end of `<body>` and then relocated into the document by an
 * inline script. For the few hundred milliseconds between those two events
 * **every element in this segment exists twice** — once live, once in the
 * staging div.
 *
 * A page-wide locator matches both, so `count()` doubles and any `expect` on a
 * non-`.first()` locator fails strict mode. It is a race, so it presented as
 * an assertion that passed everywhere and then failed once, in one project,
 * with "resolved to 2 elements".
 *
 * Scoping to the `main` landmark removes it at the source rather than papering
 * over it with `.first()`: the staging div contains no `<main>`, and "what the
 * customer can see on the page" is what these assertions mean anyway.
