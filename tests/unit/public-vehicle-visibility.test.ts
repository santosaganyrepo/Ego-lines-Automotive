 * The public marketplace must never show a vehicle that is not PUBLISHED.
 *
 * This is the Phase 6 trap in one sentence. The admin list query applies no
 * status filter by default — correctly, because an operator has to be able
 * to find a vehicle they archived — and reusing it behind /cars would put
 * unfinished drafts, sold cars and withdrawn listings in front of customers
 * at prices nobody meant to publish.
 *
 * Two things are asserted here, and they fail for different reasons on
 * purpose: that the public reads pin the status no matter what they are
 * asked for, and that no customer-facing route imports the admin module at
 * all. The second is what stops the first from being bypassed rather than
 * broken.
