/**
 * The public parts catalogue must never show a part that is not PUBLISHED,
 * and must never carry an internal column to the browser.
 *
 * Two separate hazards, and the parts domain has both where the vehicle
 * domain has one.
 *
 * The first is the familiar Phase 6 trap: the admin list query applies no
 * status filter by default — correctly, because an operator has to be able to
 * find a part they archived — and reusing it behind /spare-parts would put
 * unfinished drafts and withdrawn listings in front of customers at prices
 * nobody meant to publish.
 *
 * The second is specific to parts: `SparePart` carries `supplierName` and
 * `supplierNotes`, which record where stock came from, what it cost and how
 * long it takes. Publishing those would hand every customer the dealership's
 * margin. The dealership has also asked that condition, country of origin,
 * pricing mode and stock stay off the public catalogue. None of those is
 * enforced by a status filter — the defence is that the public DTOs never
 * select the columns, which is what the last group of assertions checks.
